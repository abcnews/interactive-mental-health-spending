Earlier this year, I tried to access the Better access mental health care plan through a telehealth service, but was told that a referral to that program was not available except by visiting a GP in person first. The nearest GP is a 9 hour drive, so being told I couldn't access the mental health support until I organised a trip and made the drive was very discouraging - it made me feel even more isolated.

The psychologist referral was made under a GP mental health care plan.  One of the reasons that my mental health deteriorated to the point that I deliberated overdosed was that I was too afraid to access support earlier.  Even now, I do not feel that I can discuss my issues fully with those involved in my care.\n\n1.  I am terrified that someone will misinterpret my issues or misinterpret mandatory reporting laws and report me to AHPRA, which could result in me losing my registration or having conditions placed in my registration.  I work within a smaller speciality that gossips furiously.\n\n2.  Having experience in the medicolegal setting, I am painfully aware that there is no such thing as privacy and confidentiality.  Anything can be subpoenaed, including those that have treated you.  Nothing is confidential.\n\n3.  I hate being labelled and I hate having particular conditions permanently recorded in my medical file.  I had to switch psychiatrists because they tried to label me with a personality disorder that I clearly do not have (and all others involved in my care were certain I did not have).  Apart from being a patently incorrect diagnosis, that particular label could have been disastrous given the stigma associated with it.\n\n4.  I am extremely grateful that I took out life insurance and total and permanent disability insurance (TDP) prior to my suicide attempt, because I doubt I would be able to find affordable insurance now that there is clear documentation of mental health issues.\n\nThe six initial psychology sessions per calendar year under the mental health care plan can be increased to 10 if the psychologist and GP feel the extra four sessions are needed.  Ten 50-minutes psychotherapy sessions are not enough to canvass decades of untreated issues.  I have already used all 10 sessions this calendar year, and there are still 5.5 months left of the year.  \n\nThe cost of treating mental health conditions is prohibitive, as it is rare to find mental health specialists who bulk bill.  Psychologists typically charge $150-$250 per session.  A rebate for a session with a clinical psychologist is $128.40 and for a session with a less-qualified general psychologist is $87.45.  Most therapy consumers are still out of pocket even with a mental health care plan.  I also get a Medicare rebate for seeing the psychiatrist, but again there is a gap fee.  My GP does not bulk bill, so again I have another gap fee to pay.  My two psychiatrist-prescribed medications are not on the PBS and cost over $150 per month.  I used to have extras cover in my health insurance, but I did not want to claim for mental health services because of a fear of my issues being documented in yet another setting.\n\nI am extremely fortunate to be able to afford to get the help that I need, and my partner and family would help out if I had financial difficulties.  I am also very fortunate that I have flexibility in my work to be able to attend all of my appointments during working hours.  However, I can't help but think that I would have better off if I could have more easily accessed proper support earlier in my life.  The fear of the stigma and fear of professional repercussions were barriers to me accessing support earlier.  These fears continue to be a barrier to me fully opening up to those who are there to help me, so my treatment may not be as efficacious as it could be.\n\nHealth practitioners are suffering and dying because of the perceived deleterious consequences of seeking help.","Are there reasons you haven't accessed this treatment?":"","If you weren't able to access the treatment you required, what was the fallout for you personally?":"","Is there anything else you'd like to share with us?":"","I'm happy for my story to be published.

There are very few psychologists who bulk bill. \n\nOn the whole an experienced counsellor is far more helpful than many psychologists.

Up to 10 sessions in a year is totally inadequate for those dealing with serious mental heath issues. Some people use these up in the first 10 to 20 weeks of the year and have no support for the remainder of the year, desperately waiting until the new year to access help again. In the meantime they lose the ground they have gained and their mental heath deteriorates to such a point that they need hospitalisation or they take their lives. Early targeted and continuing intervention is well known to alleviate many of the more serious issues that flood our mental health facilities. \nIt is well known that you need to be wealthy or totally incapacitated in order to get the support many need.","I'm happy for my story to be published.

However, I have been very fortunate to have a supportive GP who has always been there to sign the paperwork needed to get my sessions. It took me a while (3 goes) to find a good psychologist who could help me. Anytime I needed to change my referral, my GP supported me to do that. I imagine that it would have been difficult to get the help I needed without it. Many people struggle to find a good psychologist who fits with them and then give up, denying themselves the chance to get proper support. \n\nHowever I work in mental health as a counsellor too and hear stories about peoples' struggles to access mental health support. Financial barriers seem to be the biggest one. Most psychologists can't afford to bulk bill and the gap can cost over $100 per session, which just isn't feasible. For people with complex mental health, 10 sessions isn't enough and they can quickly run out within the year. Also, it can take time to find the right psychologist, meaning that you can burn through a few of your 10 sessions before you have found someone who can help you. On top of that, huge wait times at most practices (even Headspace which gets a lot of Government funding) can discourage people from help.","Are there reasons you haven't accessed this treatment?":"","If you weren't able to access the treatment you required, what was the fallout for you personally?":"","Is there anything else you'd like to share with us?":"As someone who's currently doing their clinical training to become a psychologist, I've gained some insight into some of the problems that I feel are perpetuating this issue. Firstly, in Australia there is a huge demand for psychologists. Most private practice clinics have month long wait lists to see someone, but there are few psychologists to fill the positions and meed the need in Australia (particularly in rural areas). I feel like this is due to how difficult it is to become a psychologist in Australia. University programs offer around 12 masters programs a year, which means that hundreds of students might graduate with a psychology degree, but only about 12 a year within that university get to study to become a psychologist. Furthermore, AHPRA has recently phased out the 4+2 program, which means that there will be less psychologists to meet the demand. This translates into longer wait times and less support for the community. The organisation itself needs to look at how they are going to increase the number of psychologists given that they seem to be closing more and more pathways. \n\nCurrently the APS quotes that standard fees for a psychological therapy session should be around $280, which many Australians wouldn't be able to afford. It's hard to find a price that is fair for clients and psychologists, because there are a lot of costs associated with practicing as a psychologist (e.g., professional development, supervision, registeration fees etc.,). \n\nBulk billing is an option for many low income clients to get mental health support. It should be noted that clinical psychologists get paid a higher medicare rebate than other psychologists (e.g., $142.50 versus $84.50). This inequity means that many generalist psychologists cannot afford to bulk bill their clients, so clients have to pay the gap. If generalist psychologists could receive the higher rebate, they would be better able to bulk bill or even charge a smaller gap to clients. \n\nLastly I feel like some GPs need to be better educated about this system and more supportive of clients getting mental health treatment.","I'm happy for my story to be published.

I have been gradually deteriorating since the psychologist I saw on and off for 12 years left Australia in June 2016. I have seen eight psychologists and one psychiatrist in that time. I was on a waiting list for six months to see the psychiatrist, all the time deteriorating though there was no duty of care or monitoring (my GP has no oversight except to keep giving me scripts for Valium). I then spent nine months trying to make it work with the psychiatrist. Initially it was difficult to get regular appointments because all I was given were the scraps of what the existing clients didn't want. This was done without regard for my personal circumstances, including my mental health needs. I have spent more days than not in the last year with suicidal ideations, which is the worst I've been. The psychiatrist diagnosed complex PTSD (I had previous diagnosis of PTSD). We could not establish a therapeutic relationship and he just led me on with the promise of therapy. He wasn't ethical in owning that he was making things worse (and it was obvious I was deteriorating). I ended the relationship with him and then saw a psychologist that a friend with PTSD had seen. The psychologist rang me after one session and said he didn't have the skill set to help me, so I continued to fall through the cracks. I then decided to approach finding a mental health professional like I did job hunting and contacted 10 psychologists. Four weren't taking new clients. I got put on three waiting lists (with at least a 3 month wait on one and at least a four month wait on the other two (and also being informed that I would then only get appointments that their regular clients don't want)). I made three initial appointments, with a four week wait for one, six week for another and two months for another. I'm now four appointments into seeing one of the psychologists and it's going okay, though we're still seeing if we have the right fit for each other and he has the right skill set. I have private health insurance, a mental health care plan and am not financially stressed (so can afford to pay to get help if only I can get access).

Turned up to the appointment, and the receptionist informed me the psychologist had just moved clinic that week - I had no notification of the move, and when I booked in, the confirmation details listed the old address. Found out the confirmation text stated the new address, but I had no reason to check, as I had confirmed address (and building) when I made the booking. Finally booked in with another psychologist (another 4 week wait), he fell asleep in the session. I desperately needed help, but couldn't face another failed attempt - my mother ended up finding another psychologist, and booked me in. Still another 4 week wait. But she was a good pscy and worth the wait. However this whole process took about a year from when I first went to the GP to being able to get proper help. I have since moved cities and need to go and see another pscy. I have got a referral from the GP but that Pysc has closed their books, so need to go through the process of finding another pscy - something I am putting off.","Are there reasons you haven't accessed this treatment?":"","If you weren't able to access the treatment you required, what was the fallout for you personally?":"There was a year of my life spent with depression and anxiety.

The 6 to 10 sessions go really fast. If you don't find a psychologist who is good at establishing rapport and assessing the situation quickly, you can run out of sessions before they have even got to know you. It's fairly obvious that most if not all mental health issues are complex, so if a psychologist is young, inexperienced, can't relate, not effective at building a connection etc etc, it can all be a waste and then you have to wait another year before getting another mental health care plan. The psychology association offers a directory on their website but how can you really tell what the psychologist is going to be like from that. On the flip side, it is excellent that our Government provides the Better Access program, but I don't think the psychology association is doing enough to make it efficient for the public to find the right person for them. Psychologists are psychologists not marketing professionals - this is where their association should be helping them by providing a better directory for the public - put videos on there or something so people can get a feel for the psychologist.

In the past I have been an active and enthusiastic participant in trauma-informed therapy from a trusted trauma-informed counselling psychologist. However, the years-long, but ultimately futile process of seeking help and information from doctors about an undiagnosed progressive physical condition (which is slowly rendering me disabled) has left me terrified of medical practitioners and the psychological damage they do through illness-denial.\n\nI am a survivor of complex childhood trauma. I have Complex PTSD and, ideally, would be recieving trauma-informed therapy on and off for the rest of my life, as well as separate and well-defined medical care. Over the last half a decade or so, I have been losing my ability to walk normally, among other debilitating symptoms.Despite numerous doctors visits, I have yet to find someone that will fulfill a  basic necessity for medical care - to work together with me on the shared goal of finding out what is happening to my body, and giving me options for how to deal with it. Doctors have deliberately and repeatedly lied to me about their intentions to help me with things such as Centrelink disability applications, advice about walking aids, and taxi vouchers. All of these things have been promised to me by doctors who will say anything just to get you out of their consult room, only to find excuses to deny you these things at the next visit.  \n\nDoctors habitually treat people like me with fake-charm condescension or barely concealed contempt at best. The worse end of the scale  includes derisive mocking, aggressisve gaslighting, derogatory or vilifying medical records, administrative abuse (including denial of Centrelink and disability services), interfering with family and social dynamics and the deliberate use of highly manipulative, and unconsented psychological interventions in lieu of proper logical medical assessment.\n\nThere is absolutely no way that I want to face the attitude of derision, and the barrage of questions you get when you ask a GP to see a psychologist - when are you suicidal, how often etc. It is as if they are accusing you of stealing psychological care that you do not deserve, and you have to jump through hoops to prove that you are deserving of care. This 'assessment' process is a prime example of the unwanted  psycho-medical interference that I need to avoid, for my own sanity.\n\nWhatever doctors are being taught about mental health is disastrous. They are on a hair trigger to reinterpret medical issues as psychological ones. I myself have been so damaged by the campaign of gaslighting that doctors are trained into, that I would need at least three or four sessions with a trauma-informed psychologist to process the trauma stemming from a single doctor's visit. \n\nI decided that continuing with my sessions was futile, as it got to the point where ALL of my sessions were being used to discuss the medical trauma that was ONGOING, due to my stubborn belief at the time that medical care should be available to trauma-survivors  just the same as 'real' people. In addition, I know that any interaction I have with any kind of psychological support will jeopardise my chances of ever recieving unbiased medical care. Doctors routinely act as if seeking psychological support renders the patient ineligible for any logically-driven physical diagnostic process.","Are there reasons you haven't accessed this treatment?":"","If you weren't able to access the treatment you required, what was the fallout for you personally?":"I have had to adapt to the harsh reality that, in order to prevent  further psychological damage from gaslighting doctors, I will live a life with neither medical acknowledgement nor psychological help. Learning to live without hope has been crucial in maintaining whatever wellbeing I have. Hope only sets you up for disappointment. Having reduced my life goals to a clean house, a fridge full of food, and the absence of disaster, has helped me immensely. I have given up on the idea of pursuing interactions with people because somewhere between intensive medical gaslighting and a false robodebt, I completely lost my ability to trust the outside world.","Is there anything else you'd like to share with us?":"I suspect that throughout the pandemic, there will be many people like myself who are triggered by the  'doctors are heroes' narrative. For many of us, doctors  are those who abuse their power to pick and choose who they see as having 'real illnesses' and demonise those who they categorise as 'somatic' or 'all-in-your-head\" patients. \n\nI want people to remember something about Ms Dhu.\nShe was killed not just by imprisonment for unpaid fines, not just by the police who manhandled her, but also (and perhaps primarily) by doctors who were so completely certain that her illness was faked that they did not carry out a logical and unbiased medically diagnostic process. \n\nDoctors are being trained to use a procedure known as the pro-active diagnosis of somatic symptom disorder. This means that they are actively encouraged to make a snap decision, right off the bat, to decide if the patient in front of them might be a hypochondriac. This decision is based on little more than feelings and hunches, and is eerily similar to to the racial and social profiling used by police departments. Guidelines are vague, and serve only to give doctors an excuse to refuse proper medical care to anyone they don't like. If you get categorised as a 'somatic' patient they will simply mess with your mind as hard as they need to for you to give up and go away.\n\nIn short, somatic (aka functional, non-organic, hypochondriac) theories of physical health problems give doctors free reign to express horrific bias against any person or group of people, with potentially fatal results, and without ever having to take responsibility for the devastation they wreak in people's lives. These are not the people I want to have as a gatekeeper for my psychological well-being. Why are they even involved at all? Why can't I just go straight to a psychologist?","I'm happy for my story to be published.

Since moving into the area over a decade ago, I haven't been able to find an accessible surgery that is taking regular new clients, and the wait times are too long with known GPs I used to see, having to wait 4-5 days for an appointment and without the option of bulk-billing. When I have had health issues, I usally go to work anyway and rely on seeing doctors at clinics in the CBD that normally handle corporate medicals and appreciate the business during downturns in the resources industry. \n\nThe other main reason I haven't sought out a referral is due to the lack of available time in working or personal hours. My job is demanding and often requires attention outside of normal working hours due to the multi-national company, and what little time I have left in my day goes to my children and spouse. The lack of available time, or even the capacity to make a commitment, prevents me from seeking treatment, as I already feel like I could burst at any moment sometimes and I don't want to open that floodgate and then be left vulnerable, unable to go on and unable to help myself let alone my family.","If you weren't able to access the treatment you required, what was the fallout for you personally?":"Being unable to access treatment means, for me, continuing the struggle of self-managing and self-treating my cycles in my mood and behaviour, a struggle I'm often afraid that I'm slowly losing ground on. At times, I have clearly struggled to contain anti-social behaviours towards friends and family, and while talking about that with them (in some cases) has helped, it only offers a brief solace before it comes around again. Sometimes it feels like it has become worse for it, now having the self-awareness of feeling it all start again but still being unable to reach out because of the same old obstacles and fears.","Is there anything else you'd like to share with us?":"A big fear of mine is what seeking help may uncover, and disturbing what little safety I have at present. One of my children was recently given a diagnosis of ASD, and the process of reaching that diagnosis and being told what may ahead in life has raised many behavioural \"red flags\" from my own childhood and my life now as I know it. I'm afraid of what I may find if I seek treatment, and how that knowledge may change my life, having seen how others are treated and discriminated against in corporate Australia.\n\nThere are also massive assumptions held about the role and accesibility of GPs in the lives of many Australians that just don't hold true. As a result, many initiatives and policies are blind to the lack of support they provide and the true size of population they reach. This is largely in part because in many places in Australia the small and tightly controlled number of GPs, and the inconsistency of professional standards and best-practice in the Australian community, creates a competative and selective market for GPs rather than an accessible service.","I'm happy for my story to be published.

Why is there no additional funding being provided through Medicare in these situations.  If the COVID item numbers are taken away in September many clients who have engaged with a psychologist via telehealth and built a relationship already will be left unable to complete their 10 sessions with the same psychologist.

I have been using these medicare subsidised clinical psychology visits since their inception under the Howard government when it was originally 18 sessions a year. They were then reduced to 12 sessions a year and then the current 'Better access' program of 10 sessions. I have written to Greg Hunt asking for more sessions and received a reply from a chap very high up in Medicare to say that they were always reviewing the rebates and that I could access more psychology etc through the Public health network in Victoria. But unfortunately this is of no use as it is only for mild or inpatient mental health (a criteria is that you have to have been hospitalized in the previous 12 months). I asked Greg Hunt why the rebates were extended for people with an eating disorder to 40 rebates a year while others, like myself who have Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, only get 10 rebates. It is prioritizing one mental health disorder over another, and the argument that psychiatry is totally on medicare, which I also use regularly does not stack up, as my clinical psychologist uses different treatments to my psychiatrist. Both work together for me. I have hit the second level of the medicare safety net in March and it is silly that while I get to see my psychiatrist for next to nothing I have to pay full out of pocket for my clinical psychologist. I am on a bit of a rant here, sorry, but I have regularly written to health ministers to try and extend the medicare rebates for clinical psychology since the rebates were reduced. Yes, it is better that I get 10 rather than none, but I can't see why eating disorders patients are prioritized. They have high morbidity rates but so does OCD, which have higher suicide rates than the general population. I have attempted suicide twice when the OCD got too much and been admitted to a hospital psychiatric unit, but only after my psychiatrist lost his temper with the ER department who were going to discharge me to go home alone. I have seen my clinical psychologist for over 15 years (I have had OCD since age 5 and am now late 40s), for most of that time on a weekly basis, so the 10 rebates don't last long. The rebates were fine when I was stable and could spread appointments out, but the last two years with an exacerbation of my condition, they are a drop in the ocean. I always wonder why, things like IVF get huge rebates from medicare, but mental health gets very little. All the inputs and funding to mental health this year from Greg Hunt's office has been into research. I have eagerly watched all the funding announcements only to be very disappointed. Huge amounts of dollars go into research, but at what point do they stop the research and actually start to help people. The fact that the money went to eating disorder rebates was no doubt an academic researcher who advises him has an interest in eating disorders.","Are there reasons you haven't accessed this treatment?":"","If you weren't able to access the treatment you required, what was the fallout for you personally?":"I have only last year managed to pay off a $40,000 credit card debt incurred for mental health treatment over the years. I am highly educated with a PhD and a Masters degree and nearly completed another Masters degree. I can only work casually as my mental health is unstable and if I could receive more treatment I might be able to work more. As it is, I have been on limited work capacity newstart/now jobseeker since 2009 because I find it hard to get the mental health treatments I need. Prior to accessing these 2 early release super payments for Covid-19, I had accessed my super four times for extreme financial hardship and all because I need the money to pay for my medical bills and my credit card debt because of these medical bills. So Scott Morrison's idea that the best sort of welfare is a job totally overlooks the fact that prior to covid one third of people on long term newstart have a medical disability and a limited work capacity as a result of this disability. When I wrote to Greg Hunt I explained that I would love to work more but not having access to clinical psychology rebates means I have to limit my visits and this impacts my ability to work more. There is something called the 'missing middle' in mental health, short term and mild mental illness is covered and so is very severe inpatient care. What is missing is the middle, long term, chronic and complex mental illness that is only receiving very limited funding and as such continues to be long term and chronic because it is almost fully up to the individual to be able to access funds such as early release super to pay for treatment.","Is there anything else you'd like to share with us?":"I would just like mental health medicare rebates to be realistic. If you can fix a mental health problem with 10 medicare psychology rebates then that is mild. What about the chronic, long-term and complex cases (unless you have an eating disorder and can get 40 rebates), we are left to battle alone trying to find money to pay for the care we need. I have been financially crippled by my medical bills, it is pretty much all I spend my money on. I have taken over the years $60,000 out of my superannuation for extreme financial hardship to help pay these bills. It was not so bad in years past when one could claim out of pocket medical bills on tax but this too has been scrapped in the last couple of years so once where I could claim the $10,000 or so yearly out of pocket medical expenses on tax, now I can't even do that.  I don't have private health insurance. I cancelled that as the amount I put into paying their fees with little refunds was better spent on paying the bills.\n\nLast year, after years of not having a GP, I found a GP who was helpful with my mental health. My psychiatrist has always referred me to the clinical psychologist for medicare rebates since John Howard's placement of it on medicare. I was never a fan of John Howard, but for this I am grateful to him. This new GP I saw regularly as a stop gap in between my clinical psychology and psychiatry appointments. I have intrusive suicidal thoughts as part of my OCD and these can be very scary. The GP, he was a registrar, was so helpful but on one bad day after dealing with centrelink I ended up in tears. At the next appointment he dropped me as a patient and said I was too dependent on him for help, which my clinical psychologist was very angry about as he had not let her or my psychiatrist know he was about to drop me as a patient. I have struggled this year with how he treated me and his apparent lack of understanding in mental health, despite earlier seeming to understand.  This is an aside, but also an example that when you have a helpful relationship with a clinical psychologist it can't be replaced with a GP who often lack in-depth mental health training, and may have stigmatized attitudes to the mentally ill.\n\nI apologize if my responses in the boxes are a bit beyond the questions asked, but I am pleased that you are highlighting mental health and medicare rebates and wanted to share my story. :)","I'm happy for my story to be published.

Both times, a mental health care plan for myself was sent back to the receptionists in the office. I found this to be so shameful - perhaps that is my own issue, but this is a small town and everyone knows everyone. I felt ashamed that they knew that about me.\nWith the first care plan, I had one session with a counsellor/psychologist, but to be honest, I left feeling worse. At one point when I confessed that I was feeling overwhelmed with the demands of the children, she sighed in an exasperated way and said ‘Well what did you expect?’ Perhaps it was my anxious state of mind, but I left feeling worse about myself and not supported by anything she had said at all. No other sessions ever occurred.\nThe second time I went to see a different doctor and another care plan was made, but nothing came of it.  I never saw anyone or heard anything about it ever again. There was no follow up by the GP or any external health professionals, so to be honest I’m not sure of the purpose of these care plans.  \nIf I had have been scheduled to see someone on a regular basis, I’m sure it would have been very beneficial at the time, but as we were a one income family then, we wouldn’t have been able to afford it. The doctors prescribed me a mild dose of Lexapro which I took for 6 months/a year and while that was helpful, I do still have health problems which are anxiety driven, such as ulcers and reflux.","Are there reasons you haven't accessed this treatment?":"","If you weren't able to access the treatment you required, what was the fallout for you personally?":"","Is there anything else you'd like to share with us?":"","I'm happy for my story to be published.

In the past, I've gone to GP's multiple times to get treatment.  The outcomes were: being given multiple anti-depressant medications that made me feel worse and gave me awful side effects, including exacerbating insomnia; being referred to inappropriate psychologists/psychiatrists who didn't seem to understand the problem and provided no feedback or assistance; sessions with psychologists and psychiatrists seemed like a waste of time and took me nowhere except down an even darker path; the whole process wore me out and left me feeling in more despair that when I started; having to tell the story over and over again to different providers was harrowing and exhausting to the extent that I couldn't stand the sound of my own voice; the waiting time to get an appointment can be several weeks or months which, in itself, demonstrates that the health professionals themselves do not consider the condition to be serious or worthy of prioritisation.  In short, trying to get quality health care for depression has been soul destroying and has invariably left me feeling completely worthless.  These days, the main thing that stops me from accessing these services is my previous experience, which has shown me that the attempts to \"get help\" through GP's care plans/ psychiatrists/psychologists result in the very opposite and exacerbate the condition.","If you weren't able to access the treatment you required, what was the fallout for you personally?":"The fall out for me personally has been job losses, relationship difficulties, financial troubles, loneliness, isolation, disconnection from community etc while dealing with episodes of major depression on my own.

The reality is that appropriate \"help\" is very difficult to find.","Is there anything else you'd like to share with us?":"The system is flawed.  It relies on mentally ill people making all the effort, which is unrealistic in light of the symptoms they experience.  It's like telling car crash victims to call their own ambulance.  I have never been able to find a good psychologists/psychiatrist that could help me.  I feel that many of the referrals were inappropriate.  If you can find a good GP, that's probably the best way to go without being referred on. You can go to a GP a few times for different ailments before disclosing mental health if you feel comfortable or you might have known your GP for a while.  Talking to perfect strangers is very uncomfortable and doesn't work for a lot of people.","I'm happy for my story to be published.

I have previously been on medication that I found to deaden my emotions, impacted my ability to feel pleasure, and impacted my ability to work. I felt that I was able to manage not kill myself without taking the medication and that this had less impact on my ability to work. This isn't advice I'm giving but this is how I feel.\n\n2. The friends that I know that are on medication are not able to hold down jobs and I don't want to be in a position where I don't have the opportunity to work.\n\n3. There is a lot of work stigma against mental illness and it is not safe to reveal that you have anxiety or depression. My experiences are that people will look down on you, they will have reduced trust in you, it results in less opportunities, and it has had detrimental impacts at three of my previous work places. 1st place extended my 3 month probation period due to my depression even though I was finishing al of my work, they removed workplace safety rules around snap shift changes and overtime work (5:30am start (from 10:30am) on 6 hours notice). 2nd place, I lost a part time position due to a stress reaction to being unable to get time off for a house move, and being expected to fill in for a colleague who extended their leave (this after a 2 years of promises that more hours would be coming when worked picked up). I had been working there for 6months as a casual before the first probation(to go full time permanent). \n3rd place I missed out on additional work after my contract ended, after experiencing depression, and due to asthma. I was working in office environments.\n4th Place had us working flat out for evaluation, they had me working nights so I lost access to my friends during the week. I stuck it out but they extended the probation period because the manager took leave and didn't finish our probation, they kept me on nights. As it was a call center we didn't have access to breaks when we needed them and were penalized if we were late back or had to go to toilet early. I was diagnosed again with depression, severe this time. I was put on medication and struggled to sleep. I quit while being chewed out, I was not supported and other team members were frequently idle.\n\nThese are the only workplaces that I have disclosed my depression to, all resulted in me losing that work.\n\n4. My grand mother was diagnosed with post natal depression when she was in her twenties. The doctors gave her electric shock treatment. she was on a large number of medications proscribed to treat her mental health, many of which were not necessary and were only stopped after years of effort by the family. Her children were placed in to children's homes.\nShe died when I was 17, in all the time that I knew her I was never able to have a conversation with her, to get to know her due to the damage that was done to her by the medical system. It badly damaged her ability to speak coherently, the sick thing was her mind underneath was still fairly sharp. You could feel her frustration that she couldn't get her thoughts across.\nPost natal depression is a fairly common illness. I can't help but think that the drugs and shock treatment had a part to play in her death at 77 years old from stroke.\n\n5. Access to psychotherapy is limited and expensive. To get access you first need to be diagnosed and referred. Getting appointments, travel and having to take time off from work are all barriers to getting enough assistance to make a positive change.\n\n6. It is impossible to take time off work as a)Casual workers get no leave, b) People with depression are frequently \n\n7. The system is focused on treatment but not cure. They will put you on drugs so you don't kill yourself, but that won't stop your life sucking and won't enable you to fix the things that need to be fixed. If you can't work due to the treatments then you actually go backwards.\n\n8. All existing treatments fail to address the core underlying causes of depression. For me these are: The absence of my father for my entire life, survival of attempted manslaughter when I was 12, difficulties with relationships specifically difficulties starting romantic relationships, lonely ness, difficulties finding full time work (of the last 20 years I have been full time for 6 of them, 4 in the last 4 years), low income, low family income, distance from family, no children, no house, high cost of living, high rents, disappointment with career direction, low options for advancements, lack of pay rises in real terms, having to take low paid work beneath your skill level.\n\n9. To access treatment will usually require multiple absences from work. This requires using sick leave, or unpaid leave. If you are a contractor you may not even be able to take time off without losing your job (Some employers won't give hours to contractors they see as unreliable). This is a long term problem with no easy quick fixes (or at least none are offered. Money after all can fix some).","If you weren't able to access the treatment you required, what was the fallout for you personally?":"I have lost 2 permanent full time jobs, I have lost the best paid job I ever had and excelled at. I'm earning 25% less now than I was before in the same industry.\nI lost a girlfriend as well when I lost that job.","Is there anything else you'd like to share with us?":"Some ideas on how to tackle anxiety and depression in our society.\nIt begins with putting people first.\n\nFull time employment needs to be the norm. Casualization has resulted in resulted in millions of insecure temporary jobs. People need real, dependable jobs to have happy healthy lives.\n\nAccess to Psychological counseling outside of work hours so people can get help without having to impact their work lives. There should be a lot of access on weekends and after 5 during the week.\n\nAccess to help should be targeted to the need, if someone needs weekly access for 3 years to heal then that is what they should get. \n\nAll Australians need access to affordable housing, and all working Australian's should be able to buy their own homes. Renting is a big source of anxiety for a number of reasons, and restricts people's abilities to enjoy their homes, and have a pet. This is also vital so that people can have a family.\n\nWe need better pay and conditions for Australian workers in general. Workers are constantly asked to help the country by booting productivity, but are not being rewarded. We are asked to work overtime for free and to except poorly trained and cheap foreign labour under free trade agreements that only benefit miners and farmers.\n\nWe need to support all our industries so that we have a full variety of careers available in this country. More opportunities so people are not stuck doing a job they hate because there isn't enough work in what they are gifted at doing, what the excel at. This means finally investing in our industrial base and investing in our games and IT industries are other countries already do.\n\nBetter public health systems especially access to dental treatments.\n\nMost importantly we need to acknowledged that Australia is a community made up of her people. We should endevor to uplift all of them to their fullest potential. So they can have pride in their contribution, live healthy lives with a family to call heir own.\n\nWe need to cure the causes, not just attempt to treat the symptoms. Not for a few, but for all of us.","I'm happy for my story to be published.

When I started taking the drugs I started having unexpected sexual problems, and didn't have the confidence/trust to talk to my GP about it because it was confusing at the time and personal.\nAs many people do I just didn't go back to the GP, I still have the box of pills years later.\n\nNobody wants to say it and even I don't feel comfortable raising the issue but some people in regional areas are fed up with the technical skills of the foreign doctors we get and we also regularly fail to communicate with them.\nI personally experienced this both of the times I attempted to get support.\nSometimes it's their English skills but more often it's their lack of understanding about our culture-  the chance of a man in a regional area being literal and frank about a mental health issue is low if they even seek support to begin with.\nIt's not their fault, it's the fault of the system for failing to train and retain doctors in regional areas.\nI had to spell out my problem to a total stranger far more frankly than I was comfortable with to even get him to understand I had a problem- and when the medication had sexual side effects there was no way I was going back to try and explain that to him.\nIt's a total can of worms, if you even mention it expect a broadside from your editor.\n\nI also had concerns about the privacy and risk of abuse of the new digital and centralized government systems like Mygov.\nI spent two hours trying to make sense of the privacy policy, it wasn't reassuring.\nThere seemed to be no concrete guarantee that physical/mental health records would be secure.\n\nSo there you go, a paranoid racist regional Australian- make of that what you will.\nAll I can say is that I'm far from the only one.","If you weren't able to access the treatment you required, what was the fallout for you personally?":"My problems weren't as bad as a lot of people's, really I'm just a dude.\nBut living with untreated anxiety problems caused me to struggle early on at school and later at work- eventually I started drinking heavily to try and manage which only made things worse.\nAs a result I moved around a lot and still don't have a GP or any connections in the health industry.\nInstead of seeking help for anxiety; I'm now seeking help for alcohol abuse.\nThese problems seem common outside major cities and are only going to get worse with the virus.","Is there anything else you'd like to share with us?":"I have read a number of your articles and would like to send words of encouragement.\n\nI've also heard anxiety is scourge among foreign students who probably have more barriers to accessing services than anyone.","I'm happy for my story to be published.

As someone with more than 5 years of experience in the system, I try to help my peers access these services as best I can; get a separate medicare card, fill in this form, try to find a practitioner that you vibe with while not using up all your sessions. Make sure that you can successfully convince your GP that you *are* worthy of treatment and a referral, all within the 15-30 minute session that you've been given by a GP (nevermind whatever other health issues you need to talk about with your practitioner). That's not easy and already acts as a first deterrant to people trying to access these services.\n\nThe money has dried up, and many practitioners can only partially cover the cost of one session from the payment that is given by Medicare, with an ever widening gap payment that disproportionately affects those who need it most. My friends are from many marginalized groups in society (queer, poor, and POC) and are only just now starting to seek help for issues that require way more than 6 + 4 personalized sessions trying to find someone who will understand their issues, they can successful communicate with, all while paying a gap that could ostensibly go towards rent, food, physical medicine. \n\nEven if you are experienced with the system and have found a practitioner that you vibe well with, external referrals to further psychiatrists can feel like a game of telephone; use one of your subsidized session to ask your mental health practitioner to write a detailed report and referral to your GP, fax your GP your information and wait weeks to meet with your GP, so that your GP can fax and print *another* referral to a psychiatrist you have no experience with who is swarmed with patients and has a three month wait list for the next appointment, all for an *INTRODUCTORY SESSION*. We *could* speed things up by just directly going to the psychiatrist in lieu of a medicare referral that takes off only *some* of the cost, but that's a $300-500 p/h fee that many vulnerable neuro-atypical people seeking treatment can't afford. \n\nThe result of this is a system that feels like walking through a field of rose bushes, to finally receive sub par treatment.","Are there reasons you haven't accessed this treatment?":"","If you weren't able to access the treatment you required, what was the fallout for you personally?":"I'm currently in the process of receiving medication for ADHD while studying at university.

It's not as if I'm not unaware of the benefits of psychology, but the stigma of it being something only \"sick and depressed people\" do, made it even less likely I'd use it.\n\nPlus there is the social and professional stigma attached to mental health and the fact that I believe our society doesn't really address mental health as much as we should. For instance, I need to ensure I use a rostered day off, from work, to go to my psychologist.

Despite having a genetic and lifelong disability that involves verbal communication challenges, and clear comorbid mental health issues such as depression and anxiety due to unaddressed needs, my GP consistently waits for me to initiate any mental health assessments or access to subsidised services. I see this as a failure on the training of GPs - they don't understand that initiating communication and discussion around mental health is difficult for some people, especially people with communication disability; and 2. Lack of accessible communication for people with disability (PWD): Even when I do get desperate enough to request access, the services that people such as I require are very specialised, and the fee gaps are far too unaffordable. People with communication disability can also take much longer to communicate needs and receive treatment, so 10 visits??? Often doesn't go very far. General counselling and psychology services rarely use accessible communication methods i.e., accommodations for people with communication and sensory disabilities. Further, there is low to no awareness of our specific communication needs and differences and/or difficulties expressing emotional and physical states. e.g., Telehealth via phone is great for some - but, for people like me, the other person cannot see me struggling to verbally communicate, so they often finish my sentences or continue talking when I haven't finished explaining or responding. It is really frustrating to see the level of free and subsidised medical and mental health services for able people, particularly now during the pandemic when access information appears almost everywhere. I would never call Lifeline, BeyondBlue etc purely based on access issues in verbal communication. People also underestimate the financial impact of disability in limiting access to (e.g.,) communication technologies and services.

You feel like a burden on everyone, stuck in a cycle of despair, and it's difficult to sustain friendships when you feel compelled to mask how you feel and put on a happy face. It is soul destroying. I am sick of hearing people flippantly say things like \"Are you ok?\". I hate RUOK day. Do people really want an answer: \"No actually - my life sucks and here's why...\" Then the standard response is often \"Oh well, things could be much worse\" or \"Try to be more positive\" or \"Have you tried talking to someone?\" I know my life could be worse, so that statement is a kick in the guts and it's unhelpful.

Inequitable access to mental healthcare through lack of awareness of accessible communication and accessible information, and lack of support via NDIS services, is something that able people will only understand if they ever have the misfortune to acquire a disability. That's our reality - very few people seem to genuinely care and even fewer act meaningfully to resolve our problems.","I'm happy for my story to be published.

I work full time, which is good and means I'm more able to afford sessions (there don't seem to be any bulk billing psychologists in the ACT) but also means that finding the time to go to sessions can be difficult. There's also the cost of actually going to the GP to get the appropriate referrals and paperwork completed.\n\n\nI first realised I needed help with my mental health struggles (major depression and general anxiety) about a decade ago, in my early 20s. At the time I was working full time and living at home (although paying board, but that's not the same as rent, utilities, etc etc) so I had the discretionary funds to see a non-bulk billing GP and psychologist; there don't appear to be any bulk billing psychs in the ACT. While I was still very ill I was cognizant that I needed help and that I would probably need to by my own advocate for the help I wanted.\n\nGoing to the GP (a doctor I'd not met before but part of a practice I'd been going to since birth) I was fully prepared to push for a psych referral instead of being \"fobbed off\" with a prescription and it left at that (like many with mental illness I thought that the issue was with me as a person, not a chemical imbalance that needed to be corrected; after 12+ months of therapy I was prescribed medication which has honestly saved my life). Luckily the doctor I saw that day was kind, empathetic, knowledgeable, and able to take the time to talk about what was going on and what kind of help I was after. He arranged for a referral to a psych that he thought I would get along with well (he was correct) and whose office was accessible via public transport. He made it clear that he was happy to provide a referral to another provider if the first didn't work out and that I should not be discouraged.\n\nThe system has worked for me; I have been able to access the professional assistance that care that I need at the right times. However, I know that a lot of that is related to the privilege I have; I was/am working full time with enough money to see a private practice GP and psychologist (even with Medicare rebate the out of pocket cost per psych appointment is $100+ still, prohibitive for a lot of people); I am white and female and do not face the same social or internalised stigma that many men and people of colour come up against when dealing with mental health issues; I was depressed and anxious but was not in the midst of a psychiatric emergency and so was able to advocate for myself and my care; being a typical Canberra girl of two public servant parents, and with a government-adjacent job myself, I know my way around a bureaucratic system.\n\nIf just one of these things had been different, if I'd had no money to spare, or got a harried doctor with no time to spare, or was less able to acknowledge or articulate how I was feeling, or access to mental health professionals was lacking (such as in many regional areas), or was just a lot sicker than I was with little support system, then I may not be here to write about it. \"There but for the grace of God\", except it's less grace of God and more specific twists in circumstances and a broken system that meant I was able to live through the experience and many others are not.","Are there reasons you haven't accessed this treatment?":"","If you weren't able to access the treatment you required, what was the fallout for you personally?":"","Is there anything else you'd like to share with us?":"","I'm happy for my story to be published.

It was approved by HR [my psychologist wrote a letter to the HR Manager] but people always whispered, wondering why I had to leave early one day a week.

The last time I tried to access psychiatric care I saw my GP who organised a care plan. I asked for a referral to a psychologist I had seen previously. I contacted her but found that she no longer bulk billed. I am on the disability support pension and could not afford to pay. I asked the psychologist if she knew of any services locally that bulk billed. She gave me a name for a clinic and I went back to my GP to get the referral changed. I rang the clinic to make an appointment. The receptionist was rude and dismissive as soon as I said that I needed to be bulk billed- and I had to be quite assertive insisting that as a DSP recipient I was entitled to be bulk billed. I waited about 3 weeks for an initial appointment with the first available therapist who bulk billed. When I had my first appointment I was disappointed to realise that the therapist was actually a social worker, rather than a clinical psychologist (I have a social work degree myself). The therapist seemed inexperienced and most of the time was spent with me filling in the same depression questionnaire I had filled in with my GP. The therapist spent most of the time telling me long rambling stories about his other patients. I  attended on another occasion and I was early. The receptionist was playing really loud hip-hop style music with lyrics about suicide- I asked her to turn the music down-she told me that she couldn't. I went to the bathroom and as I walked along the corridor I could clearly hear every word that another client was telling his therapist in another consulting room. I attended three times in total. I would get text messages asking me to confirm attendance with a therapist I had never heard of-when I tried to contact the clinic I was told they had a 'glitch' in their system. The whole experience left me feeling that the  clinic existed to harvest medicare rebates, that there was a complete lack of respect for clients, and that the therapists were inexperienced and ineffective. The experience left me feeling more depressed. I sought a referral from my GP to see a psychiatrist as I felt that I might need to go back on medication. I was told there was only one clinic in Brisbane where I could be bulk billed by a psychiatrist- this is in Springwood about 18 km from where I live in Rocklea. I do not drive. The trip there would take about an hour and a half on public transport. I waited about 6 weeks for an appointment. During that time I spoke to an acquaintence who said her experience of this clinic had been very bad-that the psychiatrist had seen her for only 15 minutes and had been very rude to her. The pandemic took effect and I changed the appointment to a telephone consult. That went quite well and the psychiatrist organised for a follow up appointment a fortnight later. I made sure to be at my phone with paperwork etc in front of me ready for the follow-up consultation. It never happened. I found the whole process so stressful that I gave up. I had since taken up a new exercise regime and determined to rely on my own devices to manage my mental health as clearly support for poor people is just not available.","Are there reasons you haven't accessed this treatment?":"","If you weren't able to access the treatment you required, what was the fallout for you personally?":"The lesson I learned from this is that the mental health system is not there anymore.

I wear my wounds on the inside. \n\nI am sick and tired of the \"Beyond Blue\", \"Are You OK?\" rubbish that society plugs. People do not want to have to deal with an employee or work colleague who has genuine mental health issues. Mental health should be a temporary glitch in your life - a person in a rut at the death of a loved one or an illness in the family. Workplaces want to be able to have a fundraiser to provide people with support. When was the last time the hat was put around at work to raise funds for \"John's recurring bipolar episodes\"? \n\nConsider this. In 2018 I was doing a research honours through university. My mental health started to deteriorate so I advised my supervisors and we extended the end date to give my mind time to settle. It finished and we moved on. I recently thought about a PhD and needed a reference from my previous study. Here is my supervisor's response:\n\n\"A PhD hey? I can provide a verbal reference if needed – although I would be very honest about our experience (both strengths and limitations) - and given it seemed you didn’t enjoy much of the process of those few years, perhaps I am not the best fit?\"\n\nIt wasn't a case of not enjoying it - I was mentally \"uncentred\". \n\nCan we cut through the shit please. Bosses, supervisors, colleagues and coworkers just want the job done. They don't care a damn about your mental health - deal with it and get the job done. Take your medication, act \"normal\" and just do your work. We have deadlines and outcomes and your mental health cannot interfere. \n\nI am deeply ashamed of my mental health. I try to project the image of a strong, proud man, but I have times when I am struck down by demons that I cannot control. I am learning to bury my mental state deep down. I try not to share what is happening in my mind. I withdraw. \n\nI do not want pity or sympathy. Mental health sufferers don't. I am sorry to all the people I have negatively affected in the past through my mental health struggles. You have not deserved to be exposed to my behaviour not matter how benign it may have been.

I've got a strict asian upbringing where mental health is brushed under the carpet and ignored. In the asian household, if you can't physically see it, it's not a problem. I was told by my family that I have nothing to be sad about and that I was just being selfish and ungrateful. I was around 16 years old when I began self harming as well and was referred to a psychologist by my high school welfare coordinator - but in oder to access that psychologist, I needed a form signed by my g.p. (which I now believe was for the subsidised sessions). But the fear of going to my family gp for a mental health reason was too high - it would not have been acceptable in the eyes of my parents, it would be a sign of weakness and failure. When I was 17, I wrote a suicide letter which was found by my mother when she was cleaning my room as I was at school. I was dragged out of school that day and instead of talking about why I was feeling that way and trying to get me help, I was lectured for being ungrateful and was told that if I really wanted to die, I should just jump off the roof then. I was told that i was given everything in the world but I was just too selfish. So instead of finding help, i was made to feel guilty about how I felt. It's been 6 years since that and being in the health care industry, I'm well aware that this subsided sessions do exist. And although I know my mental health is not good, I am still fearful to go get these sessions - fearful that a relative or family friend will hear that I've gone to get help for my mental health and that would bring a sense of shame to my family.","If you weren't able to access the treatment you required, what was the fallout for you personally?":"The fallout is that I never truly learnt how to manage my mental health - I do not have the best coping mechanisms or skills.

I eventually got fed up with her attitude and the high cost of regular appointments that didn't seem to be getting me any better meant that I dropped the talking therapy part of my mental health treatments. Unfortunately that experience left me feeling reluctant to try it again - especially after various family members had their own poor experiences with finding suitably compassionate psychologists.\nI ended up having a major depressive episode before I was lucky enough to stumble upon a psychologist who was both local, affordable, and her therapy style worked really well for me.","Are there reasons you haven't accessed this treatment?":"","If you weren't able to access the treatment you required, what was the fallout for you personally?":"Cost was a huge factor that played on my mind a lot of the time. The rebate was pathetic when I first started, and I was often left $100 out of pocket, which is a lot of money for a single woman in their 20s and 30s to afford when trying to pay all the other bills.\n\nThe next biggest factor was the fear of not finding a psychologist whose therapy style doesn't work for you personally. There is a disturbing lack of empathy shown by some counsellors/psychologists/psychiatrists. It can be difficult to build rapport and trust with someone who dismisses some of your feelings because they want to move on from a recurring issue that bothers you. (this latter experience was my mother's with a counsellor/psychologist under the Better Health system). \n\nLocation played a reasonable amount of importance, as well as time. I'm fortunate that my current psychologist has certain days in which an after-work hours appointment can be booked. I don't want to have to take personal leave to attend routine appointments that I need in order to function like other human beings. Though mental health stigma is slowly becoming better, it's still not something I'm comfortable with colleagues, managers or my workplace knowing about unless it's directly affecting my work.","Is there anything else you'd like to share with us?":"The recent covid-necessitated switch to telehealth psychology appointments have been a blessing. I don't have to worry about travelling, I can arrange to be set up in a private room of my own home, I can get the help I need, and the other benefit is that we can have the appointment earlier in the evening while I've been in lockdown because I don't have to worry about whether or not public transport will enable me to make the appointment on time. I'd really like the telehealth appointments to continue, as it means I don't just have to look for someone locally (something I found difficult living in a new outer suburbs growth area of Melbourne). There's huge benefits for patients to be in a safe space. For my disabled sister, it would be even better because she doesn't have to worry about cancelling because she's unable to travel beyond the house. She ended up being told off by two psychologists that she'd not yet seen because she cancelled her appointments after ending up unwell, and since then has been too frightened to try again, despite knowing that she really needs the mental health care help.","I'm happy for my story to be published.

It's tough to balance having to take leave, the guilt of doing so as well as the internalised shame of people at work \"finding out\". The sessions are tough for me and I end up emotionally drained so I need to have the end of the day session, if I forget to book 3-4 weeks in advance, it's impossible to get an appointment. Even with Better Access, I still had to pay $100 out of pocket. Now that my 10 sessions is up, I am paying about $230/session. I have finally recognised this is important and without help I may not survive so I am deliberately prioritising this despite it not being financially that viable especially as the anxiety medication I take is not PBS supported either (around $70/4wks). When I was younger, this was a massive deterrent. The stigma means I've only recently accepted (on good days) medication is OK, therapy is OK rather than a sign of failure. Previous therapists that were not the right fit also did not help and deterred me, there is not enough public education to inform that it's OK to change therapist, therapy only works of the patient trusts the therapists - cultural sensitivity is essential to provide a safe space (I've had one psychologist basically just read pamphlets to me; I've recently realised that having a POC therapist has made a huge difference to my outcome as previous non-POC could not or would not understand my lived experience, a lot of my trauma has been racism related including the abusive relationship I was in) . 10 sessions is not enough for people who have been through trauma, I'm privileged enough to still be able to afford sessions monthly (though maybe not for too long) , but it's not quite enough. For the last 3 weeks I was spiralling but I waited until my session yesterday instead of reaching out my therapist earlier. Looking back, I needed help a lot sooner, a lot of trauma has been relived through lockdown, the BLM etc. I am lucky I got through it. 10 sessions may not even be enough to find the right therapist. There has to be a better way so people who need it can still access help beyond 10 sessions, why isn't there an MBS item without referral?

I have had to spread sessions out to monthly due to my 10 limit being reached, I am still finding myself not coping well in between as it's not enough. 50 minutes x 10 is not enough to try and understand the root of the trauma, let alone find coping strategies and tackling the problem.\n\nI didn't know that I needed to or how to seek culturally safe therapy. I was in therapy whilst in an abusive relationship and the therapist did not recognise the  gaslighting my ex was doing to me, instead supported my ex and made me feel like it really was me. There were racial elements to that abusive relationship, they were not able to understand that either. I was with my ex for 4.5 years, I briefly saw a POC therapist who recognised these elements and started the domino effect (still took over a year) fo me to get away from that relationship. Ironically, had it been recognised sooner, I would not be requiring so much therapy now. My ex was the one that told me I needed therapy as a means of gaslighting, having the therapist validate that just made things so much worse. Though I am doing alright, I feel battered, my self esteem and confidence is awful, I had to take time out of my career, though I'm back now, I still struggle, Ive turned down dream jobs bcs I simply don't feel capable mentally.

These all are massive additional cost, it should be recognised that physical health is also affected. If I had not happened yo see this particular GP, I believe I would still be in the abusive relationship. I sincerely belive it was a matter of time before the abuse would become physical, it was only threats when I left, but if I had not met that GP and been given the right support - I may not be here anymore. I had started to abuse substances to cope in the last 6 mths or so of the relationship, I am lucky to get out before that became habit.

But 10 sessions don’t go very far when you are in a spiral and very quickly I maxed out a credit card paying for additional sessions out of pocket. I had to wait for the year to end before getting more help on a new plan but now was being asked by the GP to go on medication which I desperately wanted to avoid. The GP only allowed 5 more sessions initially and I was forced to go back again to seek approval for the rest but it meant again being pressured to go on medication. \n\nI eventually stopped going because the combination of the financial burden stress, being asked too many times to go on medication and having to ‘ration out’ the 10 sessions for the year got too much to manage. I was ‘on the mend’ and decided to continue on my own without the support and hoped that someone else would be able to benefit like I did by giving up my bookings.\n\nIt’s weird because access to the initial sessions literally saved my life. But 10 sessions a year is not enough fans to continue to get the support I needed was not an option for a number of reasons. Which just put me back at higher risk of panic attacks and ending up suicidal again. \n\nConversational Behavior Therapy can be efficacious and work wonders for some people, but the standard medical system/practice is geared towards treatment by drugs being the only course of action...","I'm happy for my story to be published.

I fear that if I use all my sessions in the first half of the year, I might struggle a lot later in the year if I need help again or face a mental health crisis. I cannot understand why there is a limit on subsidized mental health sessioms. Mental health is as important as physical health. If we don’t have a limit on how many times we can claim a rebate for seeing a GP, then why do we have a limit for the number of times we can see a psychologist? Another issue is the large out of pocket cost. The rebate should be increased to align with the increasing costs charged by psychologists. Also, it is nearly impossible to find any psychologist that would bulk billed. People who have mental health conditions are usually already stressed about the impact of their condition on their finances (such as the possibility of impacting their ability to work), it is unreasonable to put people in a place where they have to make a decision between paying a large out of pocket cost to see a psychologist and get better mentally, and putting food on the table to be healthy physically.","Are there reasons you haven't accessed this treatment?":"","If you weren't able to access the treatment you required, what was the fallout for you personally?":"","Is there anything else you'd like to share with us?":"","I'm happy for my story to be published.

Mental health plans and the better access program have never been widely available for the bulk of counselling services - previous counsellors have told me they were either not eligible to register or found the process of registration too difficult to navigate and update. The rebate from a mental health plan covers only part of the cost of most sessions, and if you see a psychologist rather than a counsellor or social worker the cost even after the rebate is prohibitive. For adequate mental health treatment 10 sessions of individual therapy is vastly inadequate, and the availability and quality of group services is not nearly enough to meet demand. When accessing mental health services, the last thing a suffering and often severely debilitated person needs is to jump through hoops - locating a therapist who offers care using the rebate plan, as well as meeting the clients financial and therapy needs (which requires either out of pocket expense, or the use of one of the ten rebates sessions), then finding a GP to refer them. Asking a severely depressed person to deal with bureaucracy to access care may be the definition of ‘cruel and unusual’.  GP’s largely have absolutely no idea how or where to refer a person suffering mental health issues, and a 15 minute appointment isn’t an adequate time to make the kind of rapport that would enable a GP to understand the needs of the person they’re referring. Over more than 20 years of treatment for chronic depression (dysthymia), and complex trauma, I have accessed the mental health rebate only twice, and paid upward of forty thousand dollars out of pocket for psychotherapy, trauma oriented therapy and counselling. The amount I’ve paid has been low in comparison with others, because counsellors have often offered me a sliding scale for payment (which came out of their pocket- another blow to professional women in caring roles), and because I have often gone without therapy I badly needed because the stress and cost of access was too high.","If you weren't able to access the treatment you required, what was the fallout for you personally?":"The healing I finally got took twenty years instead of perhaps 5 or 10. The stress of living in ongoing financial hardship because I was using my income to pay for essential health services rather than to save (for example, for a home deposit or retirement) or to live well, has been immeasurable. My financial situation and professional life has also been impacted severely by having to invest my energy in staying stable and paying for services, rather than in investing my time and energy in a career, family, or financial security. Without adequate mental health support, it has taken me fully ten to fifteen years to reach a level of professional achievement that would be normal for a recent graduate.","Is there anything else you'd like to share with us?":"Mental health services urgently need to be included in Medicare. Comprehensively. We’re letting people suffer, fail to flourish, and all too often die because we’re worried about the financial fallout of care. The lost “productivity” of those left behind in a system that only offers adequate care for the wealthy is a national shame, not to mention the personal despair to which we condemn those suffering, and the vast (vast) inherited suffering of loved ones, dependants, and friends impacted by untreated mental illness, trauma, the psychological burden of chronic illness or pain, and simple, garden-variety anxiety.","I'm happy for my story to be published.

The schools I attended also did not provide them with support to get me that help so I bumbled along as an anxious kid and teen without sound developmental support, which tracked well into adulthood.\n\nAs an adult, I realised my anxiety was not normal, but fear of stigma around being branded \"mentally ill\" held me back from accessing help that I needed for years. \n\nI finally found the courage to seek help when I was in my 30s and mostly well, however, even then, cost was a challenge as I was studying, but my family assisted, knowing it was necessary and very long overdue.\n\nThe following year, after a relationship breakdown, my anxiety was out of control and I knew I needed to go back to my psychologist. I had just changed GP clinics, and saw a new GP and asked for a new referral. I was told it couldn't be done as I should have booked a longer appointment. I got the obligatory \"are you going to kill yourself\" question and was told as long as I wasn't going to kill myself then I could wait until another time and book the correct, longer, more expensive appointment. I was humiliated - the intimation to an anxious person was that they'd done the wrong thing, and should have been smarter about seeking help. At a time when I was incredibly raw and fragile, just asking for that referral had taken every ounce of courage I had, and I was so rudely denied it. The doctor eventually relented and gave me my referral, but made sure I knew it was taking up his valuable time and was a great inconvenience.","Are there reasons you haven't accessed this treatment?":"","If you weren't able to access the treatment you required, what was the fallout for you personally?":"Although these access schemes weren't in place when I was a child, not seeing a psychologist as a child/teen damaged my confidence throughout my adult life - it's impacted confidence, resilience, strategising through challenges, you name it. While I'm happy I've done good work NOW, it's been a lot harder and a lot longer than it could have been if I'd had good support as a kid instead of going it alone.\n\nAlso, I was super lucky to have good rapport with my chosen psych from day 1, but I know so many people who don't build good rapport with the first therapist they find, and then think they can't find others - there needs to be much better support around having the opportunity to find a therapist you can work with. 10 visits is bugger all if it takes 4-5 different appointments to find a good therapist you can work with, and 10 visits with a professional you don't connect with can be even more damaging than getting no help at all.","Is there anything else you'd like to share with us?":"Sorry I haven't given you my details.

It's disgusting and discriminatory.\n\nLastly, I work in healthcare, and I see lack of resources on so many fronts, including for many different professionals who don't know how to engage with someone who discloses a mental health concern - it's not part of the training for so many health professions, yet any one of us can build enough rapport with someone that they trust us enough to disclose their problems to us. ALL frontline health professionals need better training, and better resources to be able to handle the risks that come with working with vulnerable people.","I'm happy for my story to be published.

Alternatively, they do not offer good options to someone like me who can't drive or use public transport for - ironically - severe PTSD / mental health reasons. \n\n* Lack of competence dealing with chronic disability of any kind, and chronic pain. I find that people on a standard Australian psychology curriculum are woefully out of their depth with complex-PTSD, as well as chronic pain and chronic fatigue issues. A lot of time is spent educating them, and knowing they won't further educate themselves in many cases. Given the comorbidity of depression and anxiety with common chronic pain issues, this seems like an incredible oversight in the current Australian psychology curriculum. \n\n* Lack of competence when dealing with LGBTQIA+ issues, particularly relating to asexuality and being nonbinary. Some therapists are getting better with this, but many are booked out for weeks to months, or not taking new clients, exactly because there's a shortage and it shows. Some therapists are even clearly homophobic, or you have to educate them as to why they're being phobic, which obviously isn't helpful when trying to access support and feeling like you can trust the person you're speaking to.\n\n* One of my registered Clinical Psychologists who is still practicing, abused me and talked openly about swinger's parties that she'd attended and then would talk about touching me to fix my aversion to touch at the time, in a way that was intrusive and didn't pay attention to my consent levels. I terminated therapy with her, afraid and spiralling, and had no idea who I could go to or talk to in order to report her. It is extremely easy for psychologists to abuse patients, and we are rarely believed, because of course we have the mental illnesses. :( It took a long time to trust any therapist after this, and I stopped seeing Clin Psychs and started only seeing counsellors and psychotherapists - after this, I stopped using the Better Access program. \n\nOther psychologists just seemed truly callous. At a time when I was at my lowest and unable to work, a psychologist through the Medicare scheme asked me to imagine just one job I could see myself doing. I said data entry, as I can type quickly and I thought I could do it at home. Immediately, and angrily, she said: 'DON'T BE STUPID, you're too smart for that, you should want to be a manager! That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard' She ignored the fact that I have never wanted to be a manager (even at my healthiest), and projected her own ideals onto me, and berated my intelligence at the same time. It was my last session with her, and I cried on the way home, feeling stupid and like I wasn't smart enough to figure out what kind of job I should want for myself. She's still working through the Medicare scheme in Perth. \n\nOne psychologist, upon hearing that I'd been sexually assaulted as a child in Princess Margaret Hospital said: 'That didn't happen. Children don't get abused in places like that.' Never mind that it was actually a huge controversy for some decades - that it children *were* abused in places like that and it went under the radar for so long. I was unable to talk about this abuse for another few years with other therapists because I was afraid they would simply tell me my experience hadn't happened. It baffles me to this day that someone who works as a psychologist genuinely thinks that children can't be taken advantage of in hospitals, and that her immediate response was to tell me that those kinds of things don't happen in children's hospitals, or in Western Australia. She's still working through the Medicare scheme in Perth. I wouldn't even consider her a bad psychologist, just incredibly, incredibly naive. \n\n* Cost. Even taking into account Medicare's assistance, and being on the Disability Pension, it's just too prohibitively expensive on a Disability Pension. Not only that, but you may need to look for more than one therapist if you have complex issues (which is common, not uncommon), and that becomes more prohibitively expensive over time. \n\n* Limits. You only have a limited pool of specialists to deal with, and many of the best or more effective are booked up or not taking new clients. If you're in a semi-rural suburb like I am, the limits become more imposing. I have never been able to find a local specialist to help me, I am always looking outside of my suburb, despite the suburb having a population of around 50,000 people. \n\n* Amount of sessions. 10 sessions might be enough to help someone who is simply looking to change a job or find a way to communicate with a partner in a generally healthy but struggling relationship, but I don't believe it's enough to deal with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, domestic violence, Battered Wife Syndrome, and other serious mental illnesses. It seems cruel to expect people with mental illnesses to get better in 10 hours worth of therapy, just because the government won't help out with more. It also leads to people victim blaming people with mental illnesses when they don't get better in the limited amount of time that they have. That is not a failure of the patient, that is a failure of the system.","Are there reasons you haven't accessed this treatment?":"","If you weren't able to access the treatment you required, what was the fallout for you personally?":"Increased suicidal ideation and suicide planning, causing significant distress for me and my friends and family. Inability to work, socialise or function, including caring for myself by providing food or maintaining a decent sleep schedule. In some cases, especially due to uncaring or at worst, abusive therapists, there was significant backsliding in all of my therapeutic progress, and a need to pay out of my own pocket to heal from abuse that had been done to me by a previous psychologist. Even uncaring or unsympathetic, bigoted psychologists who are queerphobic can do immense damage by implying that your sexuality is a mental illness, or suggesting that the way you live the best parts of your life - that you enjoy the most - are damaging simply because they don't want to understand gender dysphoria or gender expression.","Is there anything else you'd like to share with us?":"I have multiple complex health issues and I receive some of the world's best care for some of them through the public health system, such as when I had cancer treatment two years ago. I am still incredibly grateful for that. I'm also cognizant of the fact that my case is complex, but I've learned after two mostly frustrating decades that there are incredible mental health professionals out there; just not most of the Clinical Psychologists through the Better Access Program that I've seen. And many were reluctant to admit they were not equipped to help me, which could have saved us both time.\n\nI would like to acknowledge that while psychotherapy and counselling and social work is often put down by psychologists, it has provided clear, functional assistance for me in a way that now allows me to work part-time while on Disability, and manage my own finances, and advocate for myself as a patient with pride. \n\nBut therapy and psychology and mental health care in Australia and Western Australia is still incredibly backwards, limited, and even damaging. 10 sessions per patient is not enough, and a limited support pool of often booked up specialists leaves some of the most desperate and marginalised patients with some of the worst or least effective psychologists. It easily damages patients as often as it helps them, and having doctors telling you to see a therapist isn't having any of the tools to begin to afford to see one, be able to get there, or find the hours for someone else to get there, or to even see one in a timely manner due to wait-lists. \n\nIt's taken me years to learn how to effectively self-advocate for myself and I'm lucky to be able to do this, as not everyone is in a place with their mental illnesses to manage it. I try and share what I can with people new to therapy in Perth, since I do still believe in its ability to help people, but I'm also realistic about what say, a young LGBTQIA+ person is likely to be dealing with if they can't specifically find another LGBTQIA+ psychologist.\n\nWhen it works, it works, and I believe I am doing as well as I am in part due to the incredible counsellors and psychotherapists I have seen (not psychologists though, at best, they have not harmed me further - I'm sure there are good Clinical Psychologists out there, but having seen 15 of them - at least 4 or 5 through Better Access care plans, I've definitely given up on that line of things).","I'm happy for my story to be published.

I had to wait more than 6 months for an appointment for myself to see a psychologist under a care plan.  I think I was given 5 sessions.   To get more I will need to wait, again.   I deal with the stress of being the carer for my husband who has a lifetime of mental health issues including bipolar, and autism spectrum issues.    When we moved to Tasmania he had to wait 18 months to get into a psychiatrist, despite having been seeing one regularly in Victoria for 20 years.  Then we moved house, still in Tasmania,  and he referred us to a colleague closer (in Burnie).  That was another wait of more than a year for an appointment, through which time he was self-medicating.  His GP was writing scripts for whatever dosage he asked for.   By the time he saw the psychiatrist he was manic, (predictably), and went on and on in the manic episode. (I was present at that appointment, at Dr's request).   The Dr said, You are not listening to me, I don't want you as a patient so go away.    He now self-doses, and his GP keeps writing scripts.    Its very challenging to live with, and at this stage I have no options left to me.","Are there reasons you haven't accessed this treatment?":"","If you weren't able to access the treatment you required, what was the fallout for you personally?":"My husband is often depressed, irritable, very difficult to negotiate with, or alternatively is mildly manic, impatient irritable and difficult.

In a lifetime of caring for a number of friends and family members, I haven't experienced this low level of care before.  Our GP provides husband with valium on request, but when I asked for a low level sleeping aid for me, (temazapan) he declined on the basis that I just needed to de-stress.  When I said I wanted to discuss my options for that he said I had had my 10 minutes, and he was running a business, not a charity, and to make another appointment.  (I did, it took 2 weeks for another appointment, where I insisted, and got my prescription..) Charming.

The biggest barrier of my clients once they receive the 10 session plan per year is that the number of sessions is not enough for moderate to severe cases. The govt. made some inroads recently with granting 40 sessions for people with Eating Disorders but presently people who are suicidal, have BPD, PTSD, sever Depression, severe Anxiety conditions such as OCD or addictions can only access 10 sessions per calendar year which is nowhere near enough. On the flip side, clients can see Psychiatrists for up to 50 sessions a year. This Medicare preference for pharmaceutical interventions over psychological therapy is doing a disservice to those who are battling mental health conditions but don't want to be dependnt on taking drugs, many of which have dubious research behind them and the possibility of debilitating side effects. If the govt. diverted some of the Psychiatry funding across to allied mental health through Better Access we would have better mental health outcomes here in Australia. Unfortunately Julia Gillard amd Kevin Rudd, when PM, were lobbied by Ian Hickie and Pat McGorry, Psychiatrists, to reduce the number of Better Access sessions from 14 to 10 for allied mental health. When it was 14 sessions research showed overwhelming positive psychological outcomes for the Better Access programme. Julia Gillard, as a result of this heinous anti-psychology lobbying by the psychiatrists, reduced the sessions allowed from 14 to 10. This was a travesty beyond comprehension. Unfortuantely the Pharmaceutical/Psychiatry lobby has huge power in this country and continue to influence Medicare funding for mental health so that the flow of money goes into their own coffers. What needs addressing here is that there has never been any research into the mental health outcomes of pateints utilising the Psychiatric Medicare Item Numbers. On the other hand, when Better Access for alliend mental health stood at 14 sessions, mental health outcomes were researched and shown to be significantly positive. Health Minister Greg Hunt is very much aware of this but continues to underfund Better Access while supporting the coffers of Psychiatry and Ian Hickies Headspace which has benefited from 100s of millions of dollars for a system that has shown to have poor outcomes with 70% of clients not benefiting. Most of the money funneled into Ian Hickie's Headspace covers management salaries and admin costs. The allied mental health professionals who work for Headspace are funded through Medicare at the bulk billing rate of Better Access, Effectively the government is handing out large sums of money to Ian Hickie and his cronies that don't even directly benefit the clients.

All my issues are caused by my disability, which was not recognised for years. Even now it is recognised, I am struggling to get help. My disability has a higher suicide risk for women than it does for men in the general population (or even men with the same diagnosis). I have been having times of suicidal wish since I was in primary school. I spent the last few years emailing politicians, community services, charities, visiting multiple GPs demanding help. I got nowhere. I said constantly that I was going to lie in a busy intersection. I got kicked out of hospital after a suicidal action and they told security \"don't let her back in\". I seriously wanted to kill myself in that moment, it felt like a dare, like nobody cared. I could not go home and wandered the streets for some time. I asked multiple times for referals to social workers and never got one. Centrelink social workers told me \"we can't help you\". Seeing a psychologist is pointless when it is the rest of australian systems causing my mental distress, rather than the way I think. It only feels worse when the only thing barely affordable is 10 psychologist sessions, so spaced out that you forget what's going on, and with no choice in who you see or anything. I don't know why no one suggested an occupational therapist, unless it was the service I had to refuse because the cheapest service found had a $90 gap (Obviously completely unaffordable to a disabled person on the dole). What I needed (and still do need something similar) was something like a social worker to see once every week or two that coordinated my needs, did health check and encouraged, mentored, and suggested all other services. But the social worker I saw yesterday indicated that without NDIS I was unlikely to ever see one.

Then the session ended. He didn't complete the form.\n\nI tried again with a second GP, he lost his temper when I couldn't describe my signs and symptoms of my anxiety, because I needed a definition between the two. Easy with physical discomforts, not psychological. But he filled out the form. \n\nHowever, the Medical Centre admin did not fill out the right paperwork. So I couldn't get a rebate for my first three sessions with a psychologist. I applied for the rebate online, but Medicare rejected the applications with an A4 page containing just one line stating I was ineligible because of \"550\". There was no reference to what that meant. \nEventually I received 2 of 3 rebates. My mental health took a dive before my third application and I still haven't followed it up.\n\nThere were only three sessions with the Psychologist because in the third session I asked her for different coping tools than the ones she had recommended. She asked me if I 'looked after myself' or had any body image issues. I was looking after myself, and of course I had body image issues but I hadn't raised them myself and they had absolutely nothing to do with the trauma I was seeking help to cope with. After a bit of coaxing she was able to get a reply from me about my physical insecurities and she recommended I get breast surgery. I cancelled the rest of my appointments.\n\nMost recently I tried again to get a mental health plan. The GP printed out the questions for me to answer myself at home. And I've found I can't do it. It's too confronting. \n\nIn any case, I've since moved to Canberra and I haven't been able to find an affordable psychologist that does not leave me $150 out of pocket per session. I'm not a public servant so this over my budget for the week.\n\nI can only imagine what would have happened in all of these circumstances if I wasn't feeling OK at the time.

It feels like the system favours the rich.","Are there reasons you haven't accessed this treatment?":"","If you weren't able to access the treatment you required, what was the fallout for you personally?":"My PTSD has worsened and I'm now struggling with depression.

But what this means is that I still don't have the tools to cope with my emotions as they come up. \nSince that last unhelpful psychologist session I've been experiencing a very difficult grieving where the death of a loved one has resulted in an increase of PTSD symptoms which are difficult to stop. It's dangerous when I'm driving, or climbing, or doing anything where I need to be in the present moment. \nIt's hard to get out of bed, and it's hard to go to bed. And it's especially difficult to talk to friends or family about it because I haven't learnt how to, from a professional psychologist.\n\nIn a new city with almost no support network, psychological help would be invaluable. \n\nThe fallout is:\n- that I'm losing my job because I can't access the right advice on how to deal with a bad workplace, while dealing with all my other thoughts. \n- I feel that I might have lost a good friend or two because I've over-burdened them with my issues. \n- I don't feel motivated anymore, I don't feel like me, and that's probably the worst.","Is there anything else you'd like to share with us?":"Yes.

Which I'm grateful for. But at some point I became terrified when I felt my impulse would overrun whatever was left of my rational voice. And at that point I called Lifeline. \n\nI wish I could remember the name of the woman I talked to. She sounded older, she was very patient. We came up with a plan to fix the situation I was in, together. I followed it. That woman was definitely my lifeboat. \n\nMaybe I just completely lucked out with a fantastic human answering the phone that day, but I just wanted to add this shout-out to Lifeline.","I'm happy for my story to be published.

I'm a busy professional but I work for a dysfunctional manager who - despite me repeatedly reminding them that I will be leaving early on day x to attend an appointment, manages to find an onerous task that absolutely must be done RIGHT NOW, meaning I miss my appointment.  This happened to about 50% of my appointments in 2018, and about 30% in 2019.  Has only happened once in 2020 so we're off to a flying start.  2.

I attend all of my healthcare in my own council area, which means I have to take more time off to get away from work, then drive back home, then attend the appointment, then drive back to work... I tend to ask for late afternoon or evening appointments to minimise the travel, but they're like hen's teeth.  No weekend appointments available which is when I'd prefer to take care of personal appointments.  \n3.  My psychologist is really bloody good and there is always a 4-6 week waiting period for appointments, which is not helpful when I can feel the black dog gnawing on my leg, for want of a better analogy.\n4.  I tend to see my GP when I have an 'real' issue (because we all know mental health is a conspiracy theory), which means if I haven't broken my arm or got a sinus infection until April, I tend to put off getting the MHCP again until then.  Also, the questionnaire is extremely awkward - giving truthful, deadpan answers to really intense dot points that the GP has to ask to lodge the plan.\n5.  Yes, psychologists are expensive.

I had lost all trust for the profession at that point and avoided all mentions of psychologists, counsellors, hypnosis, CBT, or anything with a psy- prefix.\nI have suffered clinical depression most of my life and because of that experience, I didn't ask for help again until 15 years later.

Years later when I successfully got psych sessions the problem became timing: I got a full-time job and had to stop my sessions. I went to a new psychologist at the end of last year, but my problem currently is I have been moved across to a different psychologist in order to better address my needs, but the new psychologist is also unsure  whether she's the right person to address my issues. First sessions are incredibly taxing on me, and I often get worse before I get better with a new psych because I have to trudge back through trauma and rehash my life again; it makes me feel as though my life is just a summary, not a full complete life that I have lived. I'm stuck in a limbo where I'm not sure this new psych can help me and I don't want to waste the limited sessions I have with her, but I could run into the exact same problem with another new psych, and I could spend all 10 sessions just trying to find a fit for me.

Then she went overseas and is now in Sydney. Because there was no government plan I paid what I could in conjunction with my health insurance. It must have cost me a fortune. By the time she went away, I was doing ok. But later, I began to slide back into depression (due to ill health). In more recent times, on the scheme (originally just 5 sessions) I went to various different psychologists referred by my GP at the time, and but never clicked with any of them. One psychologist, said \"Oh, you are just the sort of person I like to work with\". She was full of things she was going to do, but actually did nothing. More recently, I was referred to another psychologist who was very nice, very interested, but again did nothing. In all cases the psychologists never really asked any questions that would actually delve into my issues - why I was unsettled, confused, unsure of myself, perpetually in pain and lacking 'get up and go'. I have now found a very good psychologist, through the help of a psychiatrist. It is my opinion that GPs should not refer to psychologists.

It ended up with the first 6 sessions costing me $420. And I got nothing out of it. And the psychologist made nothing of it. Needless to say, I was angry and very disappointed and told my GP (who also did not appear to be that fussed). I have since changed GP and everything else!","Is there anything else you'd like to share with us?":"I do not believe that GPs should make referrals to psychologists, unless they have a proven record of association with a psychologist, regarding a specific area of psychology - such as 'general psychology', 'pain management', PTSD, 'post-natal depression', 'older male depression', 'gender specific depression', 'youth depression' etc. \n\nI think one of the reasons why GPs don't always know of good specific psychologists is that they are unaware of which psychologist is specialised in which area, which is partly the fault of the way psychologists advertise. Look through a list of psychologists and many of them claim to cover just about every area of problems - or are so specific that they count themselves out of any other area of psychology.  \n\nThere are some very good psychologists, and I have now been lucky enough to find one.","I'm happy for my story to be published.

Often the personality of a psychologist, their methods of treatment, communication style etcetera may not be a good mesh with myself, or any individual seeking mental health support. This means that it could take two or three visits to different psychologists before finding the right one. Perhaps longer. And then much time has already passed, it takes time to get an appointment. Mental health can get worse, and a number of subsidised visits have already been used up before progress has been made.

They'll actively seek advice from me, and have done so regularly over the years. Its like because I've spent so much time with a psychologist, I now act as one for them. I also think they're all very concerned of the stigma of seeing a psychologist. It seems that once they do, they're admitting to themselves that they have a problem they're ashamed of having (but ironically proud and supporting of my mental health journey).\n\nIn my experience access to the treatment isn't the problem, its more so getting people to make the crucial step of seeking it out themselves and getting over the stigma.

Getting a single or multiple appointments weekly is difficult, and usually these aren't at a regular weekly timeslot. I was not working at the time so I was more flexible in fitting in with the psychologist availabilities, otherwise I might have only seen them once every few weeks. You could also be waiting weeks or months for a first available appointment. If I was needing as many appointments as I did then now while working full time, I could see this being very difficult without flexibility of work commitments. These long waiting times has definitely made me reconsider phoning up to make an appointment in the past, because when you need help right now a week can feel like forever.  \n\nBut before even finding a psychologist, asking your GP for a referral was one of the hardest steps for me. Because it's admitting you need help to someone else, and probably a majority of the time, a perfect stranger. So having a good relationship with your GP is very important, you need to feel comfortable to discussing these extremely personal issues openly. I have know my GP since before I was even born, so they have seen everything that has been wrong with me other the years. But even still, it was still a hard and awkward conversation to have. Plus you only have 10-15mins to talk about it with them before you are push out the door. Finding the confidence as soon as you walk into the GP consultation to say, hi, I need help because all of these personal things have, or are happening to me and it's debilitating, I don't know what to do: it is very hard but important step on the road to recovery. \n\nAlso, getting access to only 10 subsidised individual sessions makes me think now what's the point. I'll need way more than that and I just can't afford it. For some I'm sure 10 is enough, but when you are just starting your treatment 10 sessions can be eaten up in under two months and achieve very little. So why start something knowing you can never finish?","Are there reasons you haven't accessed this treatment?":"","If you weren't able to access the treatment you required, what was the fallout for you personally?":"If I hadn't receive the treatment I did at the time I would have had to take that issue on by myself until it got worse, then I don't know. Take up more resources down the line. Go to hospital or a mental health clinic for more serious issues and treatments. I did have private health cover which did cover mental health therapy session (e.g. psychologists, psychiatrist, etc) but there was still a decent gap to pay: there always is. \n\nThe problem with mental health issues, like anxiety, is that it never really goes away, you just get better at managing the causes and side effects. So early education and help was extremely important to me in my treatment. It's like anything, if left untreated it just gets worse.","Is there anything else you'd like to share with us?":"I think it is very important we, as a society and culture, make seeing a therapist for your mental wellbeing as mundane, but more importantly as accessible, as going to the doctor for when you are ill. No one should think less of a person for seeking help when they need it. I definitely benefited greatly from this system, but not by this system alone which is the issue. Being able to access mental health care quickly, cheaply and over a long period of time is essential to people's long-term mental health wellbeing.","I'm happy for my story to be published.

That I started to understand that I was okay and that my being Transgender was not an illness or a sin. It was just part of who I am.

It took a long time to get to my current mental health. It was a lot of hard work that I do every day.\nI no longer see anyone on a regular basis.

At one point my parent took me to our church leader who treated me as a sinner. \nI was in the end left to suffer with depression and a parent who compounded it with abuse. It lead me to abuse drugs and alcohol at an early age to cover up all the pain. In 2000 I started to battle my addictions and I came clean and have stayed that way for 20 years. But living with a parent who abused I did not have a healthy role model in relationships. In the end, I married someone who was just as unhealthy as my mother was and I accepted the abuse as normal. But it wasn't until someone outside of my relationship told me and I got the help that I escaped it with my children.","Is there anything else you'd like to share with us?":"I think the biggest lesson I learned was that I was okay. That it is okay to say enough is enough when it comes to abuse in any form. That it is okay to restart life and place yourself first. Even though it might be difficult anything worthwhile is.

Cost is another significant issue.\n\nLast year I had an acute experience of mental illness. My university offers up to six free sessions with a university counsellor, so I booked in for one of those when things started to get out of hand. It was very hard to get a booking, and I was advised to wake up at 6.30am to get an emergency booking - a little difficult when part of one's experience of mental illness involves difficulty getting out of bed in the morning. \n\nAfter one session, the uni psychologist referred me to the university GP for a mental health care plan, and she then referred me to an external psychologist. I was on a waiting list for this external psychologist for about 11 weeks before I got a place. \n\nBy the time I got to see the new psychologist, I had simply had to work through the issues for which I had originally sought mental health care. If I hadn't done so then I would have been in a very bad state by the time help was available. The psychologist repeatedly asked me why I was there and what I was hoping to get out of the sessions with him, making it clear that he didn't feel I had a sufficient reason to be there. I felt the same, and had to keep reminding myself that I had been pretty significantly suicidal for a several weeks, just three months before. When I started to tell him about these issues he told me I was clearly a very emotional person and was clearly prone to excessive outbursts of emotion. Then he asked me again what I was seeking help for. After three sessions with him I gave up. \n\nI am a university student. I live away from my parents and have supported myself through university for the past 6 years. I do receive youth allowance, but this only covers my rent so I have to work to afford food, transport, uni expenses and medical care. However, I'm limited in how much I can work by the Centrelink payment thresholds. If I worked more, the payments would be cut off, and I'd have to do a hell of a lot more hours to make up for it. So, a catch-22 situation emerges where I'm stressed by my workload, which feeds into my mental illness, but I can't earn enough to fund proper mental health care. This is a system where you strive all you can but just never get ahead.\n\nI've been obliged to seek bulk-billing options while studying, possibly at a time in my life when I've most needed good care. I would gladly pay for mental health care if I could - I will certainly be happy to if I ever need to see a psychologist when I start working full time. When I think about my experience of mental health care as a low income person, I think the situation is pretty alarming. I have been very lucky to be supported by friends and family, and have not been prevented from working and studying long-term by my mental illness. This comes from a certain level of privilege, which many many others in Australia do not have. Mental health care needs URGENT funding and better training for those working in the field.","Are there reasons you haven't accessed this treatment?":"I used to have a lot more faith in counseling and psychologists. I've stopped accessing treatment recently because I don't think the options that I can afford have much value. There are two main reasons for this: lack of continuity of care and poor quality care when it is available. \n\nThe way that mental health care is funded, especially for people with a low income like me, you end up being shunted from one person to another. They ask the same questions again and again, and you have to tell the story of everything that happened up to that point to give each new mental health care worker enough context to offer meaningful advice and care, or refer you on to the next person. This adds a lot of stress and strain at a point which is usually pretty acutely bad (obviously  bad enough that you're seeking mental health care). \n\nI think this experience speaks to a broader issue which I have often encountered in mental health care. When I was first seeking treatment a few years ago, my original psychologist placed a strong emphasis on building my personal support networks - seeking support from family and friends and asking for help when I needed it. This was how I discovered that my parents are reliable people to talk to in a crisis, and how I also found that many of my former friends were not able to help me in the way my psychologist had told me they would. They didn't want to have anything to do with me when I told them I was struggling. \n\nAlmost everyone I have spoken to when things have been tough for me has said the same thing: 'I think you should speak to someone about this - why not reach out to (*insert family/friends/counsellor/psychologist* here) and get some help?' I've been told to go off on my own and 'have a good cry' or, worst of all, have been totally cut out by that person. \n\nI think all Australians are implicated in this issue. We need to get better at supporting our friends and family who are living with mental illness, and not just telling them to speak to a professional and vice versa. Professional mental health care needs to be better resourced so that there is continuity of care. \n\nI have become self-reliant when it comes to mental health care, because I have repeatedly found I can't access support when I need it. It took a lot to ask for help in the first place, and frankly it's pretty uncertain whether or not it will pay off. This is a tough and scary process, and I still sometimes worry that one day the safety net I have built for myself might not be enough to keep me safe.","If you weren't able to access the treatment you required, what was the fallout for you personally?":"Hmmm... this isn't an answer to this question but I just noticed that I have to 'opt-in' to anonymity","Is there anything else you'd like to share with us?":"A handful of people know about my mental illness. I've seen and experienced enough stigma to want to keep it that way. That's why I want to remain anonymous. \n\nThat's a luxury though. Mental illness, especially at the level at which it affects my life, is a largely invisible disability. Disability isn't about what impairment a person has anyway, it's constructed by society. It's manifested in society's treatment of a person and the barriers placed around them. I never publicly talk about my experience of mental illness, not because I'm ashamed of it, but because I know that for some unfortunate people it will permanently affect the perceived legitimacy of anything else that I say.\n\nIt's amazing what people will say to you about others if they think that you're not part of the group they're talking about. Once the HR manager at my workplace (not in Australia luckily) told me about all the \"crazies\" (with Bipolar Disorder) he had seen walking around on the streets when he visited New York. \n\nI've lost people by telling them about my mental illness. By not disclosing it I can call people out for expressing unkind opinions about mental illness and offer them a more understanding viewpoint, without risking more hurt to myself. Of course what I tell them is strongly informed by my own experience, but they don't need to know that. I've found people are far more willing to be gently educated by someone they view as a peer than by someone they think of as being from that 'other' group. I recognize that it would be really powerful for me to actually tell people - to show them that the person they see as 'normal' also happens to live with mental illness. Still, my past experience makes me reluctant to do that at this stage.\n\nI'm immensely grateful to people who do speak out publicly about their experience of mental illness, their approach is bolder than mine.","I'm happy for my story to be published.

When my anxiety is really bad, I'd need to see a psychologist once a week to make any progress, but having access to only 10 subsidised sessions means that I tried to 'ration my sessions' out over a longer period to make them last. Which meant that every time I went to the psych, I was pretty much starting from square one again and made no progress. You also have to use at least one of the ten sessions, probably two, to tell your new psychologist your story and develop a rapport. And if you find that you don't 'click' with that particular psychologist, you have to use yet another one of your 'allocated' sessions to try someone else. Choosing a psychologist is a highly personal process and the limit on the number of sessions you can have means that many people (myself included) settle for a practitioner who isn't quite right for them because they don't want to go through the rapport building process all over again or are worried about using up their visit 'limit'.

Vulnerable clients often take a long time to build a relationship with a counsellor. Trust issues are usually a real problem for people who have been traumatised. \nMental health continues to be stigmatised, despite the fact that the mind is a part of the body that can be injured just as easily as a leg or an organ. \nSadly, some therapists are abusive rather than helpful.

I don't need to learn to live independently, I already do that quite successfully, nor do I wish to share space with recovering addicts and sicker people than myself. \nSo I just had to wait.

This can and sadly may lead to suicide for some of these people.\nAlthough the government can trot out 'studies' to prove how terrible the opioid crisis is and how concerned they are about opioid overdoses, this is not the lived experience of many people.\nRarely does a GP suggest that a person being rushed off opioids would benefit from counselling, instead patients are being bullied, threatened and intimidated by GPs who are running scared themselves by the governments sudden changes to the use of these medications. Having no control, no choices is adding to the trauma of already traumatised people who did not choose the pain conditions they live with, nor did they write their own prescriptions decades ago when opioids were found to be, and for many, remain, the best medications for pain.\nThis is just one issue where access to mental health providers is lacking. Add to that the ongoing trauma of the bushfires in my area and now the covid 19 pandemic and we have a recipe for increases in the numbers of people suffering with mental health issues, with limited places to turn.\nI do not know the answer but I do know the government is out of touch with the problems experienced by anyone with mental health issues. \nI would rather the millions promised to the defence forces, the forestry industry, apple growers and wineries go to helping people with very real, disabling and sometimes fatal, mental health issues.","I'm happy for my story to be published.

A few ineffectual sessions with a counsellor failed to make any difference and in desperation I discharged from the ADF. My condition continued to spiral out of control until my family took control and made an appointment with a GP, who after reviewing my questionaire responses immediately prescribed at anti-depressant and referred me to a psychiatrist for review and a psychologist for counselling.

Being able to see a good psychologist has, in the past, meant the difference between being bed- and house-bound with major depression and anxiety for months vs being able to be a healthier and more productive member of society.\n\nThe main factor that has made it difficult for me to access the service is the out of pocket cost - about $60 per session.\n\nI am 55 and have had little paid work since I was retrenched from full time work at a university five and a half years ago. I do not receive Centrelink payments. \n\nI am surviving by living a very lean lifestyle and redrawing from the mortgage. (When I had full time paid employment, I worked hard to pay the mortgage down as quickly as I could, so was ahead in payments when I was retrenched). \n\nLast August, I was mainly confined to bed for two months with major depression. Coupled with sometimes severe anxiety, I was often unable to leave the house to obtain food. \n\nThe out of pocket expenses of seeing a psychologist through the plan - which would likely have helped me to recover much quicker - and an increasingly dire financial situation meant that I didn’t obtain help from the psychologist.\n\nI was fortunate to eventually connect with a community health care centre that assisted me, for no charge.\n\nIn the past month, i have become unwell again and have again sought help through the community centre. \n\nI don’t wish to go to the bowels of hell again and have decided that seeing the psychologist may well be a financial investment I may need to make, in the hopes that it will restore my health to a state where I can obtain at least some paid work.\n\nI have searched online for bulk billing psychologists, without success.\n\nIf they were more available, it would be an enormous help to people who have limited financial means.","Are there reasons you haven't accessed this treatment?":"","If you weren't able to access the treatment you required, what was the fallout for you personally?":"I became very ill. I was basically a body that was breathing but doing little else.\n\nI felt unable to deal with people, so restricted contact. \n\nI was unable to answer or make phone calls. The most I could cope with was checking the phone every few days for text messages. I did this solely to avoid worrying people and to let them know I was still alive.\n\nOne person who noticed my long absence from social media left a message - which I felt unable to check and therefore respond to - drove some distance to my house to check on me. A number of people she knows have ended their lives and she feared I was another one to do so.\n\nAsleep with earplugs in, to ensure I could be unconscious and pain-free for as long as possible, I didn’t hear her knock.\n\nShe called the police. They got into my house to confirm I was still alive. I was mortally embarrassed, but they were very kind and understanding.\n\nIt would have been much better to have felt able to seek the help I needed than to become this unwell,  to worry people and consume police resources.","Is there anything else you'd like to share with us?":"Despite the out of pocket costs, the Better Access plan is saving lives and I am grateful for it.\n\nThank you for what you’re doing to highlight the importance of maintaining mental health.\n\nI’m enjoying this week’s focus on radio of mental health and appreciate the ABC very much.","I'm happy for my story to be published.

The psychologist should be able to trigger the extension if they believe it is in the patient's best interests without the need to go back to the gp. and they should be able to extend beyond the ten sessions too if they deem appropriate/required. - psychologist should be required to advise the gp if this happens.\nMore shared care collaborative team mindset between psychologist and gp required -especially where medication is involved.\nPlans need to allow family members to attend the psychologist without the patient if patient resists treatment or psychologist needs to change family / caregiver behaviours to assist patient. This is important in OCD and anxiety to assist family/caregivers through the process of withdrawing accomodating behaviours that can exacerbate/entrench patient OCD/anxiety.","Are there reasons you haven't accessed this treatment?":"GP refused to write a plan for our child because the GP said he(the GP) objected to the scheme because believed the scheme just lined the pockets of psychologists.

Our experience is that some complex conditions (OCD GAD School Refusal) cannot be resolve in 10 sessions and this adds a layer of stress and potential failure of the treatment when stopped prematurely due to financial considerations. \n\nThere is also the issue of needing to try different psychologists to find one that fits - ie actually has relevant condition-specific treatment success and gels with the patient - that dynamic is vital to treatment success. Just because they treat a condition doesn't mean they use the best technique or do it well ie treat but not successfully. - this is particularly true of OCD using CBT with ERP.

My boss (a nutcase) suspected I was not up to the task of doing my job, so I would make excuses or hide the fact I was needing the sessions.","Are there reasons you haven't accessed this treatment?":"","If you weren't able to access the treatment you required, what was the fallout for you personally?":"The problem I had was that I thought I was locked-in to seeing the psychologist that had been suggested.  I didn't like him at all, and got very little benefit out of the sessions.  I didn't like his type of therapy (CBT). He was religious, and I am not.  That made me uncomfortable, although I admit it was my problem, not his.  He more enjoyed telling me about the local history of the area (I was new in town), and recommended some books about that.  \n\nSo, the fallout was I did not get any assistance with my issues.  It was a waste of time and stressful because of what I outlined above (cost/getting time off work).  It has also left me quite cynical about seeing one again.  \n\nThat's when I started drinking heavily.","Is there anything else you'd like to share with us?":"I know not all professionals are the same, but I would re-emphasise the prohibitive cost of seeing a specialist counsellor/psychologist and that shopping around to find one you 'click with' means the 10 visits p.a. get used up very quickly.  \n\nIt is also difficult to see someone when you need the help.  I waited up to three months to get an appointment.  By then for many, it could be too late.  It took a lot for me to ask for this kind of help, and when I finally got the courage to pick up the phone, only to be told of a significant delay before the first available appointment, it was very disheartening.","I'm happy for my story to be published.

that I needed help (after a few times when I found myself battling unwanted thoughts of self harm) I found the biggest barrier was cost, and time.\n\nDuring my initial subsidised sessions I was somewhat embarassed to ask for the time off work, as my coworkers would inevitably ask what was wrong, was I sick, etc. I was embarassed, and didnt want to mention my condition, yet at the same time felt that I had to so that they wouldnt assume that I was taking weekly sick leave for something physically severe like cancer treatment or something.\n\nAnother barrier was the cost, despite being subsidised, each session was costing me around $100 from memory (it was nearly 10 years ago now)\nAs part of my anxiety/stress was related to my financial and work situation, taking extra time off,

that I needed help.\nFor years prior i had silently dealt with anxiety, depression, and the related health problems to those conditions.\n\nThe main barriers to me initially seeking help were:\n\n- feeling that, as a male, seeking help was seen as weak.\n- Not knowing that a GP was able to help with mental health\n- Assuming that psychologists were only for people with extreme mental health concerns.\n\nProbably the biggest barrier, initially, was that as I lived in a rural area, there was very little privacy.\nEvery person in town always seemed to insist on knowing everybody's business, this led to a fear that if I ever mentioned that I was having difficulty coping, that the entire town would know about it and ostracize me.","If you weren't able to access the treatment you required,

cope, but mostly, to normalise my issues to the point where I no longer fear people finding out that I have mental health concerns.\n\nIf I had not been able to access help at the time, I most likely

when my father was having difficulty coping after his only remaining brother passed away.\nWe sat down and spoke freely with each other, I finally revealed to him that I myself suffered from mental health issues, and that I had in the past considered ending my life.\nWhile it was a difficult conversation for both of us, it genuinely helped us all.\nI understood my father better than ever, and most importantly, dad knew that the feelings he had weren't strange, weren't a sign of weakness, and that help was available if he wanted it.\nBoth from professionals (which he did seek eventually), and from myself.\n\nJust being able to freely speak about his own mental health helped him so much, and being able to freely speak to him about my own issues meant that he didn't feel alone in the battle.\n\n\n\n\nAlso, thank you ABC for running these stories, they help us all so much.\nIf you have any questions at all, about my personal experience, about specific symptoms I have/do experience, or anything at all, please feel free to ask me.\n\nAlso, please don't feel concerned if you have any queries that you may feel are too personal, or that you may think could trigger bad memories for me etc. A large part of the difficulty in understanding mental health is that people are concerned to ask certain questions, which just leads to an odd taboo around them.\nI understand that many people may not be comfortable answering some questions like that, but I am letting you know that I am comfortable with it.\nSo feel free to ask.\n\nThank you.","I'm happy for my story to be published.

I have complex mental health issues and it has been difficult to find a Better Access eligible service that can be truly helpful. In the past I used the scheme to see a clinical psychologist. Unfortunately, the practitioner was not trained in the therapies I needed and the treatment was not particularly helpful. I need to see a dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) informed practitioner for borderline personality disorder (BPD) and post traumatic stress disorder. Other treatments are minimally effective, and this is backed by the science. Fortunately I had access to DBT via the community mental health services in 2012/2013 but I have not had any beneficial treatment since then. Importantly, men are not eligible for this service due to outdated government funding data based on gender bias in diagnosis of BPD. Men with BPD have no public options and the private options are delivered by private hospitals at a cost of around $9,000 for 12 weeks (as opposed to the 12 month best clinical practice). Besides the lack of specialisation and regulation of claimed specialisation, the amount of sessions allocated under Better Access is woefully inadequate for anyone experiencing mental health issues that aren't mild to moderate. It's fine for treating a bit of depression or anxiety, but it leaves people with severe and/or acute needs to their misery. The gap between services continues to cost lives while the government dithers about spending.","If you weren't able to access the treatment you required, what was the fallout for you personally?":"My recovery has taken over a decade. If I had access to adequate treatment and support I would not be stuck in a nearly uninhabitable community housing property living below the poverty line on Centrelink payments with a poor quality of life. My recovery trajectory would have been much neater, and I would have returned to university to complete my degree. I would have returned to gainful employment and contributing to society. I would still have relationships with my biological family. Maybe. Thinking of what might have been is a rumination trap for me that I try to prevent on a daily basis. The only positive aspect is that I have made the progress I have by myself. I quit alcohol 6 years ago after a decade of abusing it. It has been impossibly hard without the support I need.","Is there anything else you'd like to share with us?":"My story is hard, but I still consider myself to be on the fortunate side of adversity. The people no longer living who have fallen through the cracks due to the inadequacy of the Better Access program and the service gaps are the real story, but they aren't around to tell it. I was nearly one of them, multiple times. The only thing keeping me alive some days is spite. I use it to campaign for better access to mental health care, as well as to support others experiencing adversity as a result of poor government. I volunteer to support people affected by and bring an end to robodebt. I used to volunteer as an advisor to the Alliance for Better Access and later the Australian Mental Health Party. My combination of lived experience and formal education in mental health and bureaucracy informed the development of policy positions with a focus on social wellbeing. I stepped back because my own life demands more resources than I have to spare to pursue any activism. It's a paradoxical frustration, and I intend to resume my activism when I have succeeded in achieving recovery to the point of sufficient functioning to enable me to devote myself to improving life for the people the government prefers to pretend don't exist because they're inconvenient.","I'm happy for my story to be published.

I always sneer whenever I hear something like  the 10 sessions a year is for mild health issues and not aimed at ongoing psychological treatment for people with chronic or longer term conditions. \nWhenever I get another care plan, I basically have to beg the GP for it. In the past I’ve been receiving treatment, which is working, and because I’m not obviously in crisis, I have been refused a plan.

The plan covers maybe half the cost of a session and 10 sessions a year is not enough. Without ongoing treatment, I lose ground on progress made and am more severely affected by stress events. I’m significantly more likely to self harm which is a well known risk factor for future health and well-being outcomes. I’m less happy and spend a lot of my life afraid and in pain. Because that’s what it is. Without treatment, I’m walking wounded even if you can’t see an obvious injury. It effects all my relationships and my work. My illness has massive impact on my life. Unfortunately sometimes I go without treatment or a care plan because I cannot afford the treatment or face the pain of trying to get another care plan. In the past my psychologist has given me massive discounts just so I can continue treatment. It shouldn’t be up to the person treating me to take a pay cut just so I can get treatment.","Is there anything else you'd like to share with us?":"I spend thousands every year on treatment. Thanks to some toxic people in my life this year, I’m probably going to need almost double the sessions this year. It’s already cost me thousands. It’s worth it but it will have an impact on my financial position and life long term. I live with my parents still and being able to pay for treatment and potentially one day own a little home for myself and to have stability in the interim are all big parts of this. \nThere doesn’t seem to be anything available for someone who doesn’t need hospital admission. It’s a mess. Most GPs should not be providing mental health care. I know that RACGP and ACRRM think they have enough training but as a patient- no, they don’t. Most GPs in my experience just want you to take antidepressants and go away. No follow up, no medication review or discussion of side effect risks. Just take the pills. \nI wish I could just get diagnosis as chronic or long term and not have to keep begging year after year. \n\nBtw please change my name and only reference my city if you use my submission.","I'm happy for my story to be published.

Many require upfront fees and Medicare provides a rebate. The fees vary and a lot of people cannot afford to pay upfront.  People on pensions like myself cannot afford health insurance. 10 sessions may sound like a good number but if you have mental health you need more than 10 sessions to get to the source and identify a plan. As I have Borderline Personality Disorder, Bipolar Affective Disorder, complex PTSD and Depression the frequency of sessions needs to be far more than 10 sessions. In my experience using the Mental Health Plan more than once is useless because by the time the Psychologist has properly assessed you there are usually only 3 to 4 sessions left which are usually a month apart.  I equate it to watching your favourite soaps where there is a cliff hanger but the channel says you have to wait another month to know what's going on. Accessing 10 sessions is too painful  because you cannot even go past the surface in 10 sessions. CBT is a 9 month program and that's because a person with Mental Health cannot be helped in 10 sessions.","Are there reasons you haven't accessed this treatment?":"","If you weren't able to access the treatment you required, what was the fallout for you personally?":"Not accessing anything given my experiences is somewhat a good thing. I say this because my past experiences under the Mental Health Plan I found myself getting no beneficial help until the Psychologist gathered all the information needed and by that time I was rushed to learn any skills to help me cope. I felt worse after than I did before.  I felt abandoned when I was continually reminded that I had only X number of sessions left. After 10 sessions most people don't continue seeing the Psychologist because of the cost. In other words, why start something that isn't going to last. Childhood trauma, abandonment, domestic violence isn't going to be fixed in 10 sessions.","Is there anything else you'd like to share with us?":"Many Psychologists must be frustrated seeing patients under the Mental Health Plan because it only covers 10 sessions.

The Federal Government is providing additional funds for mental health due to COVID-19 and the bushfires yet no change has been made to people who suffer mental health as if we don't matter.

Really, it is everyone’s problem. Mental health is as important as physical health, and ensuring people can appropriately address their mental health concerns is key. The better access program is funded only for short term interventions, which does even come close to meeting the needs of many people experiencing emotional or mental distress.","I'm happy for my story to be published.

I was also implied to be prescription shopping by another GP at that practise when I came in to refill a script for valium for my anxiety, six months after I'd last been prescribed for daily use.

I have tried many times over the years without success. As a teenager, I had chronic fatigue syndrome which most doctors believed was a mental rather than physical illness. I had to see a psychiatrist who told me I was making everything up for attention. He also gave me anti-depressants which made me suicidal. I never told anyone though. I just stopped taking them. I think that experience caused a lot of the problems I have now.\n\nAs an adult, I have spoken to my GP several times about mental health. I think his advice is somewhat clouded by the fact that he treats my older sister who has lifelong mental health issues and by comparison I probably seem okay. He has referred me to at least two psychiatrists but both have been very expensive (at least $200 per hour). At the end of one of the sessions, the psychiatrist said she didn't know what the problem was. This was extremely disheartening because it had taken a lot for me to speak to the GP and then attend the appointment. Most recently, he told me to just do more things to stay active. I have never been offered subsidised sessions despite being on a health care card and not having full-time employment. I had vaguely heard about them but understood you had to have a diagnosed condition. I am not sure my doctor has ever diagnosed me with a mental health condition although he does seem to think I am prone to depression.\n\nOutside of the GP, I have tried to contact other mental health services. The last one was community mental health services because I had read about them in the newspaper. It said you could refer yourself for an appointment but the woman who answered the phone actually laughed at me and said it didn't work that way. She then seemed to realise what she had done and gave me another number for a triage service. I phoned them and he asked if I was suicidal. I told him no and he said he couldn't get help then and even if I was suicidal I wouldn't want to attend the community clinic because I would get a permanent record. I didn't really understand what he meant but I got the sense it wasn't a good thing.","If you weren't able to access the treatment you required, what was the fallout for you personally?":"I know I still need help but I have given up now. There seem to be a lot of services (for example, there are six phone help lines listed on this web page alone) which makes it hard to know which one to contact and none of them actually help me. I don't know if it's because I am a quite person and don't explain what is wrong very well or there are just not services available for people who are struggling but still getting by in life. It all seems to cost too much too. I am trying to save for a house and $200 per session just seems like such a waste of money. I can't seem to talk to anyone non-professional either (like family or friends) because rather than listen they say I should \"talk to someone\" by which they mean a professional. It just seems to be the way people deal with mental health issues now like they are scared to give the wrong advice. I just keep any problems to myself. I don't want to have to keep going through different systems and ending up not getting help. I think each time I fail it makes it harder to deal with the actual mental health issue in the long-term.","Is there anything else you'd like to share with us?":"","I'm happy for my story to be published.

When I was a student at LaTrobe University there was a mass shooting in my hometown in the US.  I saw someone then and he just brushed me off with, \"It happens all the time there, why are you so upset?\" He was so casually dismissive, so callous, so uncaring.  Immigrants always have to put on this happy face - oh yes, I'm so grateful to be here; oh, it's wonderful; I'm so lucky to live here - and that is, in and of itself, a significant cause of stress, especially now, when I can't leave the country and I'm feeling trapped; but I don't think an Australian psychiatrist would be any different to any other Australian, who, inevitably, always get defensive if I am honest.   And that's what I need - someone who understands how stressful it is to always have to wear that mask even as, each and every day, I feel more and more trapped here, more desperate to leave, more resentful of the closed borders that keep me from being with my elderly parents (even though the case load is so much greater there, and yes, I know it doesn't make any rational sense for me to want to fly into the eye of the storm.)  So I try my best to hold it together until the kids go to bed, and then I collapse into the mess I feel inside.

While sessions were subsidised, I still needed to pay for the sessions up front before applying for the rebate from Medicare, and this was difficult to manage without going without other things in an already frugal life. There was also a gap between the fee and the rebate. I had already established a relationship with a psychologist through recommendation, and felt that there was understanding and progress taking place. I didn't wish to see someone who needed to be brought up to speed with my story with a background and rapport that had already been established, as well as a plan that reflected my own capabilities and led me to further learning. This continuity of care was very important to me as well as presenting better 'value'.\n\nIn the end, after my financial situation became more stable, despite being offered a new supported mental health care plan, I was able to visit my psychologist through my workplace's employee assistance program and self-funded as a regular touch-in.

I saw a psychologist through my GP because, at the time, I had been long term unemployed due to my medical condition (Multiple Sclerosis). I was volunteering for a few organisations but the fact that I wasn't making money was getting to me. I started seeing a psych who ended up asking more questions about my condition than about how I was going in the grand scheme of life. For example, I would begin talking about an experience to do with, say, travelling on public transport and I would get asked why I didn't have a license. I told them that I don't drive any more because of my MS symptoms. I then had to go into what those symptoms were and how they were caused because (by admission) they didn't know much about MS. After conversing about how MS affects me my appointment time would be over without me talking about anything I actually wanted or needed to. It could be thought that the psych was wanting to know about my MS but I wasn't getting asked how my condition affected me in any other way than 'so what do you mean when you say you're right leg doesn't work properly?'

People have said that you need to try a few to find the right one but having a condition like MS means that it is so tiring attending appointments, meeting new doctors and telling them your story multiple times.

She mentioned that we could set up a care plan to get subsidised visits with the specialist, but she was concerned that just having had a care plan at some point would then always be recorded.

She was concerned that could affect my future health insurance options.\n\nNow I don't know if that is really true, but I like her as a doctor because she doesn't exaggerate and doesn't make assumptions. She really doesn't seem like the type to believe in conspiracy theories.\n\nSo I looked up the specialist she recommended and it was at least $350/session. And I'd need multiple sessions.

Fear. \nI had terrible experiences with psychologists and psychiatrists before, and I was vaguely stable. I didn't want to risk destabilising myself with a bad psych, and then only have a couple of visits left to find a new psych and restabilise.\n\n2. Amount of sessions.\nAs someone with a complex (not really, just consistently poorly treated) condition, I need to be able to access sessions if a crisis happens. This means I'll \"save up\" sessions. Instead of addressing issues when I'm healthy and able to process things, I save my sessions in case a crisis happens, or something traumatic happens. Without support from my psychologist I end up in the emergency department.\nRelated to this is the time limit of 6 in 12 weeks, then a further 4 if necessary. When you get a MHTP in a semi-crisis setting, you use it. You may be on the road to recovery, you've seen a professional once a week for 4 weeks, and you're definitely safe to taper down to a visit every 10 - 14 days. Unfortunately you only have 2 visits left to cover you for the next 8 weeks, and you stare at your options: pay out of pocket? stop going?. Both lead to a breakdown, an escalation of care, and often undoes progress.\nI've also stopped treatment because a plan wasn't working. If you have a treatment plan laid out over 9 sessions, but you aren't able to process all you should've in the early sessions, you see that this treatment will stretch out to 12, 15, 17 sessions. So you stop the treatment very early to avoid being left without access to a rebate in a very precarious mental position.\n\n3. Cost\nThis is almost the most important, and ties into the amount of sessions. The rebate is $84.80. Apart from headspace and state run initiatives, I have never been bulk-billed. A psych who ensures their space is accessible to themselves, to their patients, who has work-life balance and who continues to do training and research will have a gap fee, and at times I have stopped going because the expense made my mental health worse than treatment could fix it.\n\n4. Doctors not filling out forms correctly. \nLiterally just the result of your doctor running 35 mins late, trying to make up time by rushing a mental health appointment and messing up the paperwork as a result.","Are there reasons you haven't accessed this treatment?":"","If you weren't able to access the treatment you required, what was the fallout for you personally?":"Instead of addressing issues when I'm healthy and able to process things, I save my sessions in case a crisis happens, or something traumatic happens. Without support from my psychologist I end up in the emergency department.\n\nI may end up paying out-of-pocket or stop going entirely, but both lead to a breakdown, an escalation of care, and often undoes progress.\n\nWhen doctors don't fill out a form correctly you spend weeks chasing people up and making and breaking appointments and it hurts your mental health so so so much.","Is there anything else you'd like to share with us?":"I'm happy for this to be published, but I'd like to see how it's been edited beforehand. My words have been twisted before and I'd prefer that not to happen again.\n\n\nThis happened over the Victorian and West Australian mental healthcare systems. Unsurprisingly, my appointments nowadays often have to address the ways the Victorian system treated me and what issues it has created.\n\nAlso, the 10 sessions is a good idea but it could be carried out better and more appropriately. As someone with a psychiatric disability, 10 visits isn't close to what I would ideally have to manage this condition. In addition, members of my family have attempted to access visits, but without being \"anxious enough\" or \"depressed enough\" they were unable to get visits, and would come along to mine in order to process their own interactions with my illness. This wasn't ideal for anyone, however it's what had to be done in order for them to be able to be around me.\n\nThe entire mental healthcare system needs to be restructured to provide better ongoing support, and increasing the rebate. In addition, more support needs to be given to regional and remote programs, and this needs to be appropriate for those communities. \n\nThe 10 visits system is a one-size-fits-most affair that doesn't fit anyone properly.","I'm happy for my story to be published.

So now if I want to pursue any further relationship counselling I can only do it with an appointment on my wifes' mental health plan. \n\nSo long story short, if you try to work through relationship issues by seeing a counsellor then don't be surprised if it comes back to bite you with your life insurer.","I'm happy for my story to be published.

The gap payment was onerous, particularly as only 10 sessions are covered, so to get an effective course of treatment the gap was actually the full cost of many sessions on top of the ten. CBT principles are useful short term to get through the day without breaking down, but basic CBT therapy - which helps you fix yourself in the moment and adapt to difficult life settings, has arguably emerged as a clinical trend to deal with the fact that only short-term treatment is funded so there is no use engaging more deeply with structural problems. Honestly, it's no use at all in dealing with the real effects of structural disadvantage, racism and complex trauma, chronic illness, or public trauma, etc - understanding how or why your relationships are disordered and how to address it. It's like a bandaid on a broken leg, think positive and do some breathing and get on with it. It feels like being gaslit when you have a real problem that demands significant work and someone wants to teach you what you are already an expert in - compartmentalising and getting on with it - as though that's actually not the major barrier to you having a happy life.","Are there reasons you haven't accessed this treatment?":"","If you weren't able to access the treatment you required, what was the fallout for you personally?":"I was lucky to find a practitioner who was useful for me after several mismatches with people who were simply not able to engage with my experience, but stopped after a few sessions.

Of psychologists who took me on, one retired after only two (I think) sessions.  Another left the area to practice elsewhere after a few sessions.  A third took me on after returning to work from a serious illness, and then died after several sessions.  A fourth was elderly, in cognitive decline, and unable to remember things from five minutes ago; I stopped seeing him after a two sessions.  None of these people should have been accepting patients in my opinion.  One GP elected to treat me himself and then attempted to bully me into joining his religion, though I do not recall if this was under the 10-session scheme.\n\nWhen I tell other practitioners about these negative experiences, they often reply something to the effect of \"that couldn't have happened.\"\n\nWhen these psychologists were unable to continue to treat me through no fault of my own, I was not referred to anybody else in the majority of cases and thrown back on my own resources.   Often I give up, the plan expires, and I try to struggle on until the next crisis.

Also the process to get a Mental Health Care Plan is also costly - in time and the cost of the GP's visit. The language involved in seeing a psychologist can be confusing for the average person.

They are not specialists in the field and these drugs have nasty side effects. The first time I saw my psych my GP was brilliant and very quickly and gently suggested I might consider seeing someone. He did suggest I consider medication but totally accepted me saying 'no'.  After two years treatment, I then had a two year break due to my psychologist taking a break from practising for study. Then the struggle got too much. By this stage my original GP was no longer practising. My new GPs' opinions were in direct conflict with my psychologist. (Across a couple months I had two GPs as one moved city.) Both GPs wanted me to use medication. Neither insisted I go back to see my/a psychologist. Both GPs acted like they knew everything there was to know about psychological treatment and the effectiveness of medication. The second GP (whom I refuse to now see) told me she actually knew better than my psychologist and that the research my psych was quoting was wrong, outdated, and was only a single piece of research (She did have a grad dip, or something, in mental health). My first GP was most joyous when I came back after two weeks of taking the medication, rejoiced that she had another success story for medication. Then she told me if it becomes less effective I could up the dose. That rang warning bells for me. At this stage I contacted my psych, who was back practising, and across the next two months I stopped the medication, under my own undertaking, and returned to visits to her. BUT, I was lucky I could afford to see a phycologist. The need to see one is directly proportioned to the cost and convenience of seeing one. Seeing a mental health professional can be life and death, both figuratively and literally. Why are these professionals so out of reach for middle to low income earners. All the MHCPs and rebates and Medicare do very little to alleviate the expense. But worse, why are GPs able to prescribe medication without the consult of a specialist?","I'm happy for my story to be published.

I wanted to discuss coping strategies and talk through other stress management methods that a psychologist might offer. Alternatively, I was considering early retirement or a late-career change, neither of which I thought were desirable.\nThe first psychologist I saw was a woman in her mid 30's. And it was only at the end of my 2nd session that I decided we weren't on the same wavelength. The first session was pretty broad ranging: you tell your life story in 30 minutes, you are asked about any known emotional trauma, your primary support network and early emotional influences, etc. The second session is more focussed, but in my case I felt the session didn't seem to be setting up an ongoing strategy for the remaining sessions. In fact I felt that she hadn't really understood how critical the problem was for me and that I was there for more than just a chat and a bit of a download.\nI asked the GP for another referral and this time saw an even younger male psychologist who seemed unsure of himself. I didn't feel like wasting more sessions so I asked for a 3rd referral. By now I had wasted over a month. \nThis time I saw a woman in her late 50's who immediately gave me confidence that she could understand my problem and suggest some options. By our 2nd session she was proposing strategies, setting me homework, and suggesting a few books I could read. She was experienced enough to ask me some penetrating questions and made sure I didn't avoid answering them. She was empathetic and I trusted her advice. \nMy advice to others is, if you've only got 10 sessions, don't waste time with a psychologist who seems too willing to let you to download endlessly about every minor emotional event in your life before eventually getting to the bigger issue that brought you to his/her rooms. If you don't feel by the end of the 2nd session they have identified some key issues and will then be proactive in guiding you to set up a self-help methodology, they probably aren't right for you. \nIn the end, you have to solve your own problems, make your own decisions. A good psychologist, in my opinion, is one that guides you, nudges you in the right direction, pulls you back from blundering catastrophe. Make sure your GP refers you to a fully accredited CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST. There are many psychologists out there (who your GP is allowed to refer you to) who don't have the extensive clinical training that comes with the advanced qualification. \nBe prepared to put some effort into solving your own problems. No psychologist can solve them for you. Find one that does more than just listen and nod empathetically, and run from one that doesn't set you homework.","Are there reasons you haven't accessed this treatment?":"","If you weren't able to access the treatment you required, what was the fallout for you personally?":"","Is there anything else you'd like to share with us?":"","I'm happy for my story to be published.

She also NEVER asked for feedback regarding how I was finding the sessions and if my needs were being met, so there was little opportunity to communicate my needs, although I tried - this is generally a symptom of the health professional viewing themselves as very much the 'expert' which is very off-putting for most people.

The psychotherapies with a 'number needed to treat' of 3-4 (3 people treated for one to show a statistically-signif diff) only look good compared to the drugs which can range as high as NNT=8 or more.

My biggest barriers are feeling I should be strong and seeking help is a weakness (stigma is real), as well as not knowing what is normal and where the line is where help is important. Reading about it is one thing, but the experience of mental ill health is something else and the two don't automatically connect.

Finding a helpful doctor, making a Dr appointment, talking to the doctor about how you are feeling (especially when they are 15 min appointments and you don't want to burden them by taking more time), finding a psychologist, making an appointment, telling your story - this is all so hard, especially when your resilience and strength feels low.

I also have a chronic health issue that contributes heavily to my feelings of depression. I have admitted myself to the ER in the past for suicidal intent.\n\nAccess has always been an issue but it’s not the only issue. I have never found a psychologist covered by the mental health care plan that is also suited to me. I believe it’s because they are in a clinical setting and seeing so many people with a variety of worries a day. So doing your own research and finding a psychologist that works for you - in my case, I specifically needed a psychologist for my chronic illness issues - usually means that the psychologist you end up seeing costs upwards of $150 a session. While this is do-able perhaps once a month, it isn’t affordable in all cases. A sympathetic psych will alter their rates, but when you are in a crisis and feel you need to see somebody once a week, that $150 or even $100 cost isn’t feasible anymore. \n\nI also refused to continue sessions with a therapist in the past as she clearly had no interest in me. Our 50-minute sessions only went for 20-25 minutes (she never remembered who I was or what was going on in my life) and she once texted me the booking confirmation for another client. Can you imagine if there had been sensitive information in that message?\n\nTo me, cost, and a system often offering sub-par care (within the mental health care plan) has stopped my time in therapy.

This was after I was told I could not have antidepressants again because of antidepressant induced hypomania by a hospital and I was referred onto her by the hospital...\n\nBecause of this; 5 years later after this incident; I started waking up really early and feeling more social and not myself (like hypomania)... However, because of this traumatic incident I did not feel like I could go to psychologist by myself... So I raised this to the psychologist and she was dismissive in one sentence... and my mother was there and agreed with her...didn't feel like pressing the issue because of my mother... Kept waking up really early but I didn't do anything about it differently (didn't wake parents up) because my mother had said you always react badly to medication...\n\nMy psychologist then told me re sleep to get out of bed if I couldn't get to sleep. When I raised them a subsequent session she told me that she didn't say that re waking up early\n\nAlso my mother got distressed about me and insisted in going in a session with me... I clammed up about worrying about being bipolar...\n\nAlso this psychologist had told me to contact previous old number before 1300 MH CALL.. So I was feeling really distressed so I attempted the old number but it didn't work... So I went to Emergency Department of the hospital close to Uni... They told me they were too busy and gave me the new number... So I gave up on talking or ringing that number because I remember how the hospital referred me to the psychiatrist who told me I had the right to kill myself.\n\nI was also told by the psychologist to contact the counselling services at the University previously (despite the website saying if you have a long term condition see someone privately)... So I made an appointment... There was a Masters Student... I don't think she knew that a hypomanic episode can make people act weird, irritable and not themselves and can cause you to lose friends... Earlier that semester, it was an anniversary of a dead friend's birthday (the grief triggered depression_; so I googled the people who were in the friendship group with the friend.. (lost them because I was doing Distance Education due to a medical condition for high school and depression and not bumping into people). Anyway, I google one of the friends and I find out she's gone back to Uni to start a music degree and is giving a concert 2 days after my dead's friends birthday... So I go to the concert (but I wasn't planning to make personal contact) only I make the mistake of sitting outside the concert room for more than 30 minutes beforehand.. Anyway, it when I made the appointment with the Masters Student... she was like when I mentioned I had lost the friend due to depression etc... it was like if you see her again it would be okay... Also tells me she thinks I'm not hypomanic\n\nThen I get suicidal because I'm having difficulty concentrating because of waking early; having flashbacks etc... \n\nAnyway, I finally muster up the courage to book an appointment to see a psychiatrist and I wait 2 months.\n\nSo I randomly climb the roof of a building at Uni, thinking of getting rid of myself... only it was meant to be sealed off but it had a brick jamming the door open. So I had rang 1300 MH CALL the weekend before and I get a nurse practitioner to assess me - saw her letter to the GP and her first sentence was about me wearing loose clothing and no makeup...\n\nSo I had gone to the psychologist after this incident and it was the end of the calendar year... She tells me in reception to not make any appointments until I have seen the doctor (I assume she means the psychiatrist because of my suicidal thoughts and how she had told me if distressed to contact 1300 MH CALL or Uni)\n\nSee the psychiatrist, and then get told in the session that he's too busy and I'm too complex for only 20 minutes for an 1hour or more initial appointment... doesn't charge any money though He then says he does medico legal stuff..\n\nAnyway, we go back to the GP... And the letter from 1300 MH CALL (which was a month ago) tells me to see a neuropsychologist... Anyway, I go there and neuropsychologist says she is going to do an expensive 4 hour assessment. My parents and I ask whether if there are any deficits whether there will be exercises to help them... So I get this report and I get told that I have low percentiles in attention and working memory... and then I get told by the neuropsychologist that she mainly does assessments (despite saying there were things one could do). So my mother did refer this onto a family friend but for the family friend after the assessment the neuropsychologist did do additional sessions with the family friend... Anyway, I got the impression that neuropsychologist assessment subsequently is more designed for people with brain lesions etc (after going to a neuropsychologist seminar out at Uni about people trying to working out the areas of lesions in the brain from various tests without an MRI and then the research was also about teaching techniques to fix those deficiencies and which ones were more effective)\n\nAnyway, I had booked another appointment with Uni (however, the counseller was also a yoga instructor so she told me to do legs at the wall for my sleeping issue). I also gave her the psychologist email address... Supposedly the psychologist had told her that she meant I was to have more sessions but because the psychologist didn't email me back (she had email with materials previously and reluctance to empathise with my symptoms I didn't make any more sessions. Also because we were told about the neuropsychologist and that the psychologist had told me to ring 1300 MH CALL; I guess I felt like that she wasn't comfortable with treating people who felt like they might have bipolar or suicidal thoughts) (Did a PhD on people with addictions.)\n\nSo I wait another 2 months for a psychiatrist and he was like I'm working on the hypothesis you have bipolar II disorder... any way the medication didn't make me feel any better and the doctor attempted to get the receptionist to charge for time I didn't have (against Medicare). Raised it with doctor and he was like \"You get most of it back, don't you","Are there reasons you haven't accessed this treatment?":"","If you weren't able to access the treatment you required, what was the fallout for you personally?":"I experienced unresolved grief of dead friend and lost friends, concentration issues, flashbacks of when I had antidepressant induced hypomania; waking up really early, crying, weird email writing on several occasions when trying to get out of Uni research experience... but I couldn't say I'm unwell because I had gotten a 7 in a course... I cannot talk to my mother about it because she get's very distressed about stuff and the fact she doesn't think that medications work for me or trusts psychiatrists... So I get myself sick (with flashbacks and grief), rack up Uni debt because I had to wait 4 months to finally see a psychiatrist after making a decision after several months because of dismissing of psychologists.. You have a weak argument for getting HECS debt removed if you have a pre-existing condition so I didn't even try..

The main problem has been therapists who for some reason don't have a Medicare provider number and for whom you cannot get a Medicare rebate even if you have a Mental Health Care Plan from a GP. I've been seeing a therapist once a week of once a fortnight for the last two years. The first one didn't have a provider number or attract the Medicar benefit, though he did charge on a sliding scale. The second therapist I saw was a councillor, not a psychologist, so no Medicare. She also was only offering Zoom teletherapy for a while at the peak of the pandemic, which I found much less helpful than face-to-face sessions, and charged the usual rate. The third did have medicare, but a long wait list. I saw her twice, but decided she wasn't the a good fit for me. I am soon to see a new therapist, who is a psychologist, sho comes highly recommended, but it is a 6 week wait to get an appointment, and she doesn't offer a medicare reimbursement in any case.\n\nAnother restriction: I am queer and trans and obviously need a therapist who is gender-savvy. I understand there are still ignorant, cissexist, and transphobic mental health proffessionals out there. I have not personally encountered a discriminatory therapist, because I have thouroughly vetted the ones I go to. In Sydney, this usually means travelling ~1 hour into the city or inner west, and being prepared to forgo Medicare beneftis if the trans-friendly, lesbian-friendly therapist happens not to attract a Medicare benefit.","Are there reasons you haven't accessed this treatment?":"","If you weren't able to access the treatment you required, what was the fallout for you personally?":"I've been lucky so far that I can afford to pay for therapy sessions out of pocket without the Medicare benefit, and so haven't actually missed out.

It would be a great help if adequate mental health services were subsidized by Medicare.

For me, psychotherapy has been an interesting pursuit, but an largely impotent tool in really helping my mental health.\n\nOriginally I was first referred after suffering from my first panic attack at 22. I then spent 2.5 years getting counselling for OCD and Anxiety from a Psychologist, who never investigated my mood or checked for depression. When I moved state in 2015 I had my first proper bout of major depression and was referred for counselling and recieved medication. I tried two psychs who I felt didnt take me seriously before I found one who was 'fine'. Learning and understanding more about depression it became clear to me and my pyschologist that although now 25 had been depressed since 15/16 - something that I, my parents and school psychologists had dismissed as merely teenage hormonal angst.\n\nFor some of us, depression and anxiety is how we are wired and they will never go into full remission. They are awful and some psychotherapy can give us some tools to understand them better and at the very least not be our own worst enemies. For some lile myself, who are hyperfunctional despite the strength of our mood disorders, we develop mental tools and cognitive behaviours to manage myself that echoe the psycotherapy techniques deployed in counselling. For people like me, I remain unsure to this day, as I continue to seek treatment in the form of psychotherapy and medication, as to when I am going to find a psychologist that actually has some tools that will help me - there is no way for me to know and its hard to investigate and find out information on psychologists and there specialisations and how they work and who they work with.  \n\nFrom what I read in the science, we still know next to nothing about depression and anxiety. Psycotherapy works for some, but it is ultimately just attempting to treat the symptoms of the disease. \n\nI'm still looking for the psychologist that will give me new tools or techniques to build the foundations of my mental health strong enough to last.","I'm happy for my story to be published.

But the referred psychologist was in Packenham (30-40 min drive). I live in Warragul (West Gippsland) \n\nThe sessions were strictly timed to about 50-55 min each. \nAbout 60% of fees (from memory) was govt funded. The rest need to be paid at each visit. \n\nI never felt I obtained value for the \"service\" that was provided. It was not deep or personal enough for me. So I attended about about 7/10 sessions after terminating as a waste of my time and $ at that point. I was not that desperate for professional help.","Are there reasons you haven't accessed this treatment?":"","If you weren't able to access the treatment you required, what was the fallout for you personally?":"I am a retired professional and I have read and spoken with friends about such practitioners, their methods and treatments, before seeking help (once). The medication I was on for 4-5 yrs was effective but made me bolder that was it wise to be. I decided I should rely less on it. \n\nThe alternative so -called psychological \"treatment\" (after stopping meds) is where I felt the quality of service was lacking. But this treatment / approach is typical / normal. The approach of getting defining the problem in first 2-3 sessions by answering guided questions while wise notes are taken. So my answers lead to a guided, obvious clinical definition and treatments based on self-realisation, acceptance (that the problem is mine) and that I fix it  (ie its all in me, not outside of me and not a responsibility of others).  I don't need a psychologist for any of that. I can do such self analysis largely myself or rely on close friends for advice and opinion. I value others opinion but often have to defend my own opinions and values.","Is there anything else you'd like to share with us?":"The above had nothing to do with COVID. It was about 10 yrs ago. My needs then were about dealing with relationships, with my wife, and post divorce with other women. I try hard to remain friends with them all.\n\nPresently, I do not feel the need for mental health \"support\"  though I live alone in my own house and I'm 75 and its lonely at times. I have an occasional partner in Melbourne. I go out with local friends for coffee & lunch every 7-10 days. I remain connected with many and use social media a lot. \nBut I could do with some physical help eg to tidy garden backyard clean gutters etc, Not being able to do that safely or adequately adds to the stress of loneliness / aloneness. \n\nNow, I would NOT turn to such professional help as my experience was disappointing. \nNow I turn to family for help and closest friends. For now that's enough. \n.","I'm happy for my story to be published.

Therefore, if the Doctor makes a mistake in the referral, or you move towns and haven’t started using your plan or are only a couple of sessions into your plan, you have to wait until a year has passed since the referral was written, before you can begin again.\n2) The discount is helpful, but even with a plan it still costs me $78 out of pocket to see a psychologist. It’s too much and prohibitive for anyone on Centrelink or with any other high debt burden or small take home pay. \n3) The first plan I had, I was unable to use as I moved cities and had to wait a year to be able to get a new plan.\n4) The second plan I had, the Doctor wrote the referral to a ‘Psychologist in Training’. A Psychologist in Training is someone who hasn’t completed their two years of supervised training and therefore, is ineligible to register as a Psychologist. Therefore, I was not allowed to use the plan with this Psychologist in Training. When I went back to my Doctor and told him this, he advised I had to wait another year before he could write me out a new referral/plan.\n5) When I finally got my third plan, I rang the Psychologist to make an appointment ASAP and the earliest they could see me was 3 months away. \n\nAll of the above (prohibitive our of pocket costs, ridiculous red-tape conditions, Doctor mistakes, and wait times to see a psychologist) has prevented me from accessing a psychologist on a number of occasions.","If you weren't able to access the treatment you required, what was the fallout for you personally?":"1) Misdiagnoses. \n2) Additional out of pocket costs.\n3) Severe and worsening stress, anxiety, depression.\n4) Arguments with friends, families, and my wife because they thought I was not interested in helping myself and they didn’t understand that despite my attempts to see someone, it wasn’t my fault that I hadn’t.\n5) Lost wages and long-term damage from remaining untreated (incalculable  from a dollar perspective)\n6) Numerous wasted hours of phone calls and repeat Doctor visits for nothing.\n7) Added stigma and insult from people.\n8) Added distrust and frustration with poorly implemented Government policies.\n9) Increased risk of suicide\n10) I married someone after only knowing them for four weeks. I’ve never been married or made any decision in my life which was so hasty and irrational.

Sure the information is needed for insurance but there is a business owners HR club out there who are trained to be biased and prejudice for many reasons to not like a person who has the skills but isnt deemed suitable for hidden reasons.

I was no good in social situations unless it was with only a few friends. Girls, no way.\nIn 1975 I had a break down. I was treated by a gp for high blood pressure, then with anti depressants. In the early eighties I was referred to a psychiatrist. I was prescribed many different meds but in all cases they did not address the core issue, anxiety. I persevered for 30 years with this psychiatrist. My wife told me to find someone else, but in the end in 2013, I made the decision to no longer see this person. I have seen other psychiatrists but with no results for the better.\nIn 2014, after I had taken on a new job I finally succumbed to physical injuries I sustained in 2008. I could no longer do the job physically and my anxiety was through the roof. My current gp said I needed to stop, With the gp's help I was put onto a disabilty pension in early 2014. I have not been able to access other treatments such as transcranial magnetic brain stimulation. Although free, the treatment centre is on the other side of the city and requires travelling there every day for two weeks. One centre offered a service at the Sunshine Coast in Queensland. That is about one and a half hours away. I had to pay for that. \nI suddenly have no interest in continuing my story which also concerns my wife and family.\nI will tell you this. If you or anyone you know is having a problem, a mental heath problem, see someone immediately.\nIf you are not happy with the psychologist, see someone else. Ditto for the psychiatrist. If you are offered any medications just be aware they can come with serious side affects. Try them but do not persist with them for more than two to three weeks. If it is suggested to persevere with a medication which is causing distressing side affects, stop seeing that person. Psychologists can't help me now, too much time has passed.

A saga over several months that resulted in my finally finding treatment outside of the Better Access program through which I had been referred. My GP was and is very supportive and tried to help me find suitable help with little success. Distance and timing were major issues: I live in area considered to be part of metro Sydney that can also be considered \"regional\" in terms of service availability. A crisis just before Christmas saw me unable to access help because of the holidays. Services were also booked up until well into January. I finally accessed limited support through a counselor using Skype (expensive although I do have private health cover) and this helped me survive. I have actually been able to get counseling support through a local agency. This is outside the public health system.\n\nI'm concerned because there seems to be a 'one-size-fits-all\" approach to mental health treatment. After an assessment at a big, well-known Sydney hospital it was suggested that a psychoanalytical approach could be best for me. Things I consider to be more \"formulaic\" seem to be the trend: DBT, CBT and so on. I guess it comes down to what works for people. \nIn a nutshell - I found the process exhausting, frustrating and worrying. I'm pretty experienced at navigating systems because of my previous employment. The process involved in accessing recommended treatment was daunting.

So I saw another, who guided me through a meditation session instead of referring me to psychological services. I didn’t know any better at the time so didn’t try again. I just kind of ‘sucked it up’ and did my best without treatment. It sort of worked for a few years to just try to white-knuckle my way through life but was not sustainable long term. And I picked up quite a few bad coping mechanisms along the way which I still struggle with today. \n\nI don’t know if the rules around it all are better now or if I just had bad luck back then, but I’ve actually been connected to the relevant services in recent years. I try not to dwell on it too much, but sometimes I do wonder how my life would be different if I’d got through to a proper psychologist ten years ago.","I'm happy for my story to be published.
