Earlier this year, I tried to access the Better access mental health care plan through a telehealth service, but was told that a referral to that program was not available except by visiting a GP in person first.

Sadly for many of my neighbours in the community, though, who struggle with their own mental health at times, the barrier of distance is compounded by a whole host of other stressors, language barriers, and possibly a dearth of mental health professionals with experience in Aboriginal Australia.

The psychologist referral was made under a GP mental health care plan.  One of the reasons that my mental health deteriorated to the point that I deliberated overdosed was that I was too afraid to access support earlier.  Even now, I do not feel that I can discuss my issues fully with those involved in my care.

1.  I am terrified that someone will misinterpret my issues or misinterpret mandatory reporting laws and report me to AHPRA, which could result in me losing my registration or having conditions placed in my registration.  I work within a smaller speciality that gossips furiously.

2.  Having experience in the medicolegal setting, I am painfully aware that there is no such thing as privacy and confidentiality.  Anything can be subpoenaed, including those that have treated you.  Nothing is confidential.

3.  I hate being labelled and I hate having particular conditions permanently recorded in my medical file.  I had to switch psychiatrists because they tried to label me with a personality disorder that I clearly do not have (and all others involved in my care were certain I did not have).  Apart from being a patently incorrect diagnosis, that particular label could have been disastrous given the stigma associated with it.

4.  I am extremely grateful that I took out life insurance and total and permanent disability insurance (TDP) prior to my suicide attempt, because I doubt I would be able to find affordable insurance now that there is clear documentation of mental health issues.

The six initial psychology sessions per calendar year under the mental health care plan can be increased to 10 if the psychologist and GP feel the extra four sessions are needed.  Ten 50-minutes psychotherapy sessions are not enough to canvass decades of untreated issues.  I have already used all 10 sessions this calendar year, and there are still 5.5 months left of the year.  

The cost of treating mental health conditions is prohibitive, as it is rare to find mental health specialists who bulk bill.  Psychologists typically charge $150-$250 per session.  A rebate for a session with a clinical psychologist is $128.40 and for a session with a less-qualified general psychologist is $87.45.  Most therapy consumers are still out of pocket even with a mental health care plan.  I also get a Medicare rebate for seeing the psychiatrist, but again there is a gap fee.  My GP does not bulk bill, so again I have another gap fee to pay.  My two psychiatrist-prescribed medications are not on the PBS and cost over $150 per month.  I used to have extras cover in my health insurance, but I did not want to claim for mental health services because of a fear of my issues being documented in yet another setting.

I am extremely fortunate to be able to afford to get the help that I need, and my partner and family would help out if I had financial difficulties.  I am also very fortunate that I have flexibility in my work to be able to attend all of my appointments during working hours.  However, I can't help but think that I would have better off if I could have more easily accessed proper support earlier in my life.  The fear of the stigma and fear of professional repercussions were barriers to me accessing support earlier.  These fears continue to be a barrier to me fully opening up to those who are there to help me, so my treatment may not be as efficacious as it could be.

Health practitioners are suffering and dying because of the perceived deleterious consequences of seeking help.","","","","Yes","","Yes","","","","",20604,"Melbourne City","Major cities - higher SES"

I can see a highly qualified, experienced and registered clinical counsellor for $80-$100 a session for as many sessions as I need/want so why would I pay for more for a psychologist and have that also on my medical record? There are very few psychologists who bulk bill. 

On the whole an experienced counsellor is far more helpful than many psychologists. In my own professional capacity  I have heard many complaints about how unhelpful many psychologists are, therefore I would recommend to others and personally choose a counsellor. Unfortunately the government does not recognise this highly skilled and helpful profession.","","I believe the offer of therapy through a mental health plan is very misleading to prospective clients as it often comes under the guise of free counselling. It is very rarely bulk billed and to those who need it most it is financially inaccessible and inadequate. Up to 10 sessions in a year is totally inadequate for those dealing with serious mental heath issues. Some people use these up in the first 10 to 20 weeks of the year and have no support for the remainder of the year, desperately waiting until the new year to access help again.

However, I have been very fortunate to have a supportive GP who has always been there to sign the paperwork needed to get my sessions. It took me a while (3 goes) to find a good psychologist who could help me. Anytime I needed to change my referral, my GP supported me to do that. I imagine that it would have been difficult to get the help I needed without it. Many people struggle to find a good psychologist who fits with them and then give up, denying themselves the chance to get proper support. 

However I work in mental health as a counsellor too and hear stories about peoples' struggles to access mental health support. Financial barriers seem to be the biggest one. Most psychologists can't afford to bulk bill and the gap can cost over $100 per session, which just isn't feasible. For people with complex mental health, 10 sessions isn't enough and they can quickly run out within the year. Also, it can take time to find the right psychologist, meaning that you can burn through a few of your 10 sessions before you have found someone who can help you. On top of that, huge wait times at most practices (even Headspace which gets a lot of Government funding) can discourage people from help.","","","As someone who's currently doing their clinical training to become a psychologist, I've gained some insight into some of the problems that I feel are perpetuating this issue. Firstly, in Australia there is a huge demand for psychologists. Most private practice clinics have month long wait lists to see someone, but there are few psychologists to fill the positions and meed the need in Australia (particularly in rural areas). I feel like this is due to how difficult it is to become a psychologist in Australia. University programs offer around 12 masters programs a year, which means that hundreds of students might graduate with a psychology degree, but only about 12 a year within that university get to study to become a psychologist. Furthermore, AHPRA has recently phased out the 4+2 program, which means that there will be less psychologists to meet the demand. This translates into longer wait times and less support for the community. The organisation itself needs to look at how they are going to increase the number of psychologists given that they seem to be closing more and more pathways. 

Currently the APS quotes that standard fees for a psychological therapy session should be around $280, which many Australians wouldn't be able to afford. It's hard to find a price that is fair for clients and psychologists, because there are a lot of costs associated with practicing as a psychologist (e.g., professional development, supervision, registeration fees etc.,). 

Bulk billing is an option for many low income clients to get mental health support. It should be noted that clinical psychologists get paid a higher medicare rebate than other psychologists (e.g., $142.50 versus $84.50). This inequity means that many generalist psychologists cannot afford to bulk bill their clients, so clients have to pay the gap. If generalist psychologists could receive the higher rebate, they would be better able to bulk bill or even charge a smaller gap to clients. 

Lastly I feel like some GPs need to be better educated about this system and more supportive of clients getting mental health treatment.","Yes","Yes","Yes","","","","",30904,"Gold Coast Hinterland","Inner regional"

I have been gradually deteriorating since the psychologist I saw on and off for 12 years left Australia in June 2016. I have seen eight psychologists and one psychiatrist in that time. I was on a waiting list for six months to see the psychiatrist, all the time deteriorating though there was no duty of care or monitoring (my GP has no oversight except to keep giving me scripts for Valium). I then spent nine months trying to make it work with the psychiatrist. Initially it was difficult to get regular appointments because all I was given were the scraps of what the existing clients didn't want. This was done without regard for my personal circumstances, including my mental health needs. I have spent more days than not in the last year with suicidal ideations, which is the worst I've been. The psychiatrist diagnosed complex PTSD (I had previous diagnosis of PTSD). We could not establish a therapeutic relationship and he just led me on with the promise of therapy. He wasn't ethical in owning that he was making things worse (and it was obvious I was deteriorating). I ended the relationship with him and then saw a psychologist that a friend with PTSD had seen. The psychologist rang me after one session and said he didn't have the skill set to help me, so I continued to fall through the cracks. I then decided to approach finding a mental health professional like I did job hunting and contacted 10 psychologists. Four weren't taking new clients. I got put on three waiting lists (with at least a 3 month wait on one and at least a four month wait on the other two (and also being informed that I would then only get appointments that their regular clients don't want)). I made three initial appointments, with a four week wait for one, six week for another and two months for another.

If you don't find a psychologist who is good at establishing rapport and assessing the situation quickly, you can run out of sessions before they have even got to know you.

In the past I have been an active and enthusiastic participant in trauma-informed therapy from a trusted trauma-informed counselling psychologist. However, the years-long, but ultimately futile process of seeking help and information from doctors about an undiagnosed progressive physical condition (which is slowly rendering me disabled) has left me terrified of medical practitioners and the psychological damage they do through illness-denial.

I am a survivor of complex childhood trauma. I have Complex PTSD and, ideally, would be recieving trauma-informed therapy on and off for the rest of my life, as well as separate and well-defined medical care. Over the last half a decade or so, I have been losing my ability to walk normally, among other debilitating symptoms.Despite numerous doctors visits, I have yet to find someone that will fulfill a  basic necessity for medical care - to work together with me on the shared goal of finding out what is happening to my body, and giving me options for how to deal with it. Doctors have deliberately and repeatedly lied to me about their intentions to help me with things such as Centrelink disability applications, advice about walking aids, and taxi vouchers. All of these things have been promised to me by doctors who will say anything just to get you out of their consult room, only to find excuses to deny you these things at the next visit.  

Doctors habitually treat people like me with fake-charm condescension or barely concealed contempt at best. The worse end of the scale  includes derisive mocking, aggressisve gaslighting, derogatory or vilifying medical records, administrative abuse (including denial of Centrelink and disability services), interfering with family and social dynamics and the deliberate use of highly manipulative, and unconsented psychological interventions in lieu of proper logical medical assessment.

There is absolutely no way that I want to face the attitude of derision, and the barrage of questions you get when you ask a GP to see a psychologist - when are you suicidal, how often etc. It is as if they are accusing you of stealing psychological care that you do not deserve, and you have to jump through hoops to prove that you are deserving of care. This 'assessment' process is a prime example of the unwanted  psycho-medical interference that I need to avoid, for my own sanity.

Whatever doctors are being taught about mental health is disastrous. They are on a hair trigger to reinterpret medical issues as psychological ones. I myself have been so damaged by the campaign of gaslighting that doctors are trained into, that I would need at least three or four sessions with a trauma-informed psychologist to process the trauma stemming from a single doctor's visit. 

I decided that continuing with my sessions was futile, as it got to the point where ALL of my sessions were being used to discuss the medical trauma that was ONGOING, due to my stubborn belief at the time that medical care should be available to trauma-survivors  just the same as 'real' people. In addition, I know that any interaction I have with any kind of psychological support will jeopardise my chances of ever recieving unbiased medical care. Doctors routinely act as if seeking psychological support renders the patient ineligible for any logically-driven physical diagnostic process.","","I have had to adapt to the harsh reality that, in order to prevent  further psychological damage from gaslighting doctors, I will live a life with neither medical acknowledgement nor psychological help. Learning to live without hope has been crucial in maintaining whatever wellbeing I have. Hope only sets you up for disappointment. Having reduced my life goals to a clean house, a fridge full of food, and the absence of disaster, has helped me immensely. I have given up on the idea of pursuing interactions with people because somewhere between intensive medical gaslighting and a false robodebt, I completely lost my ability to trust the outside world.","I suspect that throughout the pandemic, there will be many people like myself who are triggered by the  'doctors are heroes' narrative. For many of us, doctors  are those who abuse their power to pick and choose who they see as having 'real illnesses' and demonise those who they categorise as 'somatic' or 'all-in-your-head"" patients. 

I want people to remember something about Ms Dhu.
She was killed not just by imprisonment for unpaid fines, not just by the police who manhandled her, but also (and perhaps primarily) by doctors who were so completely certain that her illness was faked that they did not carry out a logical and unbiased medically diagnostic process. 

Doctors are being trained to use a procedure known as the pro-active diagnosis of somatic symptom disorder. This means that they are actively encouraged to make a snap decision, right off the bat, to decide if the patient in front of them might be a hypochondriac. This decision is based on little more than feelings and hunches, and is eerily similar to to the racial and social profiling used by police departments. Guidelines are vague, and serve only to give doctors an excuse to refuse proper medical care to anyone they don't like. If you get categorised as a 'somatic' patient they will simply mess with your mind as hard as they need to for you to give up and go away.

In short, somatic (aka functional, non-organic, hypochondriac) theories of physical health problems give doctors free reign to express horrific bias against any person or group of people, with potentially fatal results, and without ever having to take responsibility for the devastation they wreak in people's lives. These are not the people I want to have as a gatekeeper for my psychological well-being. Why are they even involved at all?

Since moving into the area over a decade ago, I haven't been able to find an accessible surgery that is taking regular new clients, and the wait times are too long with known GPs I used to see, having to wait 4-5 days for an appointment and without the option of bulk-billing. When I have had health issues, I usally go to work anyway and rely on seeing doctors at clinics in the CBD that normally handle corporate medicals and appreciate the business during downturns in the resources industry. 

The other main reason I haven't sought out a referral is due to the lack of available time in working or personal hours. My job is demanding and often requires attention outside of normal working hours due to the multi-national company, and what little time I have left in my day goes to my children and spouse. The lack of available time, or even the capacity to make a commitment, prevents me from seeking treatment, as I already feel like I could burst at any moment sometimes and I don't want to open that floodgate and then be left vulnerable, unable to go on and unable to help myself let alone my family.","Being unable to access treatment means, for me, continuing the struggle of self-managing and self-treating my cycles in my mood and behaviour, a struggle I'm often afraid that I'm slowly losing ground on. At times, I have clearly struggled to contain anti-social behaviours towards friends and family, and while talking about that with them (in some cases) has helped, it only offers a brief solace before it comes around again. Sometimes it feels like it has become worse for it, now having the self-awareness of feeling it all start again but still being unable to reach out because of the same old obstacles and fears.","A big fear of mine is what seeking help may uncover, and disturbing what little safety I have at present. One of my children was recently given a diagnosis of ASD, and the process of reaching that diagnosis and being told what may ahead in life has raised many behavioural ""red flags"" from my own childhood and my life now as I know it. I'm afraid of what I may find if I seek treatment, and how that knowledge may change my life, having seen how others are treated and discriminated against in corporate Australia.

There are also massive assumptions held about the role and accesibility of GPs in the lives of many Australians that just don't hold true. As a result, many initiatives and policies are blind to the lack of support they provide and the true size of population they reach.

I have been using these medicare subsidised clinical psychology visits since their inception under the Howard government when it was originally 18 sessions a year. They were then reduced to 12 sessions a year and then the current 'Better access' program of 10 sessions. I have written to Greg Hunt asking for more sessions and received a reply from a chap very high up in Medicare to say that they were always reviewing the rebates and that I could access more psychology etc through the Public health network in Victoria. But unfortunately this is of no use as it is only for mild or inpatient mental health (a criteria is that you have to have been hospitalized in the previous 12 months). I asked Greg Hunt why the rebates were extended for people with an eating disorder to 40 rebates a year while others, like myself who have Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, only get 10 rebates. It is prioritizing one mental health disorder over another, and the argument that psychiatry is totally on medicare, which I also use regularly does not stack up, as my clinical psychologist uses different treatments to my psychiatrist. Both work together for me. I have hit the second level of the medicare safety net in March and it is silly that while I get to see my psychiatrist for next to nothing I have to pay full out of pocket for my clinical psychologist. I am on a bit of a rant here, sorry, but I have regularly written to health ministers to try and extend the medicare rebates for clinical psychology since the rebates were reduced. Yes, it is better that I get 10 rather than none, but I can't see why eating disorders patients are prioritized. They have high morbidity rates but so does OCD, which have higher suicide rates than the general population. I have attempted suicide twice when the OCD got too much and been admitted to a hospital psychiatric unit, but only after my psychiatrist lost his temper with the ER department who were going to discharge me to go home alone. I have seen my clinical psychologist for over 15 years (I have had OCD since age 5 and am now late 40s), for most of that time on a weekly basis, so the 10 rebates don't last long. The rebates were fine when I was stable and could spread appointments out, but the last two years with an exacerbation of my condition, they are a drop in the ocean. I always wonder why, things like IVF get huge rebates from medicare, but mental health gets very little. All the inputs and funding to mental health this year from Greg Hunt's office has been into research. I have eagerly watched all the funding announcements only to be very disappointed. Huge amounts of dollars go into research, but at what point do they stop the research and actually start to help people. The fact that the money went to eating disorder rebates was no doubt an academic researcher who advises him has an interest in eating disorders.","","I have only last year managed to pay off a $40,000 credit card debt incurred for mental health treatment over the years. I am highly educated with a PhD and a Masters degree and nearly completed another Masters degree. I can only work casually as my mental health is unstable and if I could receive more treatment I might be able to work more. As it is, I have been on limited work capacity newstart/now jobseeker since 2009 because I find it hard to get the mental health treatments I need. Prior to accessing these 2 early release super payments for Covid-19, I had accessed my super four times for extreme financial hardship and all because I need the money to pay for my medical bills and my credit card debt because of these medical bills. So Scott Morrison's idea that the best sort of welfare is a job totally overlooks the fact that prior to covid one third of people on long term newstart have a medical disability and a limited work capacity as a result of this disability. When I wrote to Greg Hunt I explained that I would love to work more but not having access to clinical psychology rebates means I have to limit my visits and this impacts my ability to work more. There is something called the 'missing middle' in mental health, short term and mild mental illness is covered and so is very severe inpatient care. What is missing is the middle, long term, chronic and complex mental illness that is only receiving very limited funding and as such continues to be long term and chronic because it is almost fully up to the individual to be able to access funds such as early release super to pay for treatment.","I would just like mental health medicare rebates to be realistic. If you can fix a mental health problem with 10 medicare psychology rebates then that is mild. What about the chronic, long-term and complex cases (unless you have an eating disorder and can get 40 rebates), we are left to battle alone trying to find money to pay for the care we need. I have been financially crippled by my medical bills, it is pretty much all I spend my money on. I have taken over the years $60,000 out of my superannuation for extreme financial hardship to help pay these bills. It was not so bad in years past when one could claim out of pocket medical bills on tax but this too has been scrapped in the last couple of years so once where I could claim the $10,000 or so yearly out of pocket medical expenses on tax, now I can't even do that.  I don't have private health insurance. I cancelled that as the amount I put into paying their fees with little refunds was better spent on paying the bills.

Last year, after years of not having a GP, I found a GP who was helpful with my mental health. My psychiatrist has always referred me to the clinical psychologist for medicare rebates since John Howard's placement of it on medicare. I was never a fan of John Howard, but for this I am grateful to him. This new GP I saw regularly as a stop gap in between my clinical psychology and psychiatry appointments. I have intrusive suicidal thoughts as part of my OCD and these can be very scary. The GP, he was a registrar, was so helpful but on one bad day after dealing with centrelink I ended up in tears. At the next appointment he dropped me as a patient and said I was too dependent on him for help, which my clinical psychologist was very angry about as he had not let her or my psychiatrist know he was about to drop me as a patient. I have struggled this year with how he treated me and his apparent lack of understanding in mental health, despite earlier seeming to understand.  This is an aside, but also an example that when you have a helpful relationship with a clinical psychologist it can't be replaced with a GP who often lack in-depth mental health training, and may have stigmatized attitudes to the mentally ill.

With the first care plan, I had one session with a counsellor/psychologist, but to be honest, I left feeling worse. At one point when I confessed that I was feeling overwhelmed with the demands of the children, she sighed in an exasperated way and said ‘Well what did you expect?’ Perhaps it was my anxious state of mind, but I left feeling worse about myself and not supported by anything she had said at all.

The second time I went to see a different doctor and another care plan was made, but nothing came of it.  I never saw anyone or heard anything about it ever again.

1. I have previously been on medication that I found to deaden my emotions, impacted my ability to feel pleasure, and impacted my ability to work. I felt that I was able to manage not kill myself without taking the medication and that this had less impact on my ability to work. This isn't advice I'm giving but this is how I feel.

2. The friends that I know that are on medication are not able to hold down jobs and I don't want to be in a position where I don't have the opportunity to work.

3. There is a lot of work stigma against mental illness and it is not safe to reveal that you have anxiety or depression. My experiences are that people will look down on you, they will have reduced trust in you, it results in less opportunities, and it has had detrimental impacts at three of my previous work places. 1st place extended my 3 month probation period due to my depression even though I was finishing al of my work, they removed workplace safety rules around snap shift changes and overtime work (5:30am start (from 10:30am) on 6 hours notice). 2nd place, I lost a part time position due to a stress reaction to being unable to get time off for a house move, and being expected to fill in for a colleague who extended their leave (this after a 2 years of promises that more hours would be coming when worked picked up). I had been working there for 6months as a casual before the first probation(to go full time permanent). 
3rd place I missed out on additional work after my contract ended, after experiencing depression, and due to asthma. I was working in office environments.
4th Place had us working flat out for evaluation, they had me working nights so I lost access to my friends during the week. I stuck it out but they extended the probation period because the manager took leave and didn't finish our probation, they kept me on nights. As it was a call center we didn't have access to breaks when we needed them and were penalized if we were late back or had to go to toilet early. I was diagnosed again with depression, severe this time. I was put on medication and struggled to sleep. I quit while being chewed out, I was not supported and other team members were frequently idle.

These are the only workplaces that I have disclosed my depression to, all resulted in me losing that work.

4. My grand mother was diagnosed with post natal depression when she was in her twenties. The doctors gave her electric shock treatment. she was on a large number of medications proscribed to treat her mental health, many of which were not necessary and were only stopped after years of effort by the family. Her children were placed in to children's homes.
She died when I was 17, in all the time that I knew her I was never able to have a conversation with her, to get to know her due to the damage that was done to her by the medical system. It badly damaged her ability to speak coherently, the sick thing was her mind underneath was still fairly sharp. You could feel her frustration that she couldn't get her thoughts across.
Post natal depression is a fairly common illness. I can't help but think that the drugs and shock treatment had a part to play in her death at 77 years old from stroke.

5. Access to psychotherapy is limited and expensive. To get access you first need to be diagnosed and referred. Getting appointments, travel and having to take time off from work are all barriers to getting enough assistance to make a positive change.

6. It is impossible to take time off work as a)Casual workers get no leave, b) People with depression are frequently 

7. The system is focused on treatment but not cure. They will put you on drugs so you don't kill yourself, but that won't stop your life sucking and won't enable you to fix the things that need to be fixed. If you can't work due to the treatments then you actually go backwards.

8. All existing treatments fail to address the core underlying causes of depression. For me these are: The absence of my father for my entire life, survival of attempted manslaughter when I was 12, difficulties with relationships specifically difficulties starting romantic relationships, lonely ness, difficulties finding full time work (of the last 20 years I have been full time for 6 of them, 4 in the last 4 years), low income, low family income, distance from family, no children, no house, high cost of living, high rents, disappointment with career direction, low options for advancements, lack of pay rises in real terms, having to take low paid work beneath your skill level.

9. To access treatment will usually require multiple absences from work. This requires using sick leave, or unpaid leave. If you are a contractor you may not even be able to take time off without losing your job (Some employers won't give hours to contractors they see as unreliable). This is a long term problem with no easy quick fixes (or at least none are offered. Money after all can fix some).","I have lost 2 permanent full time jobs, I have lost the best paid job I ever had and excelled at. I'm earning 25% less now than I was before in the same industry.
I lost a girlfriend as well when I lost that job.","Some ideas on how to tackle anxiety and depression in our society.
It begins with putting people first.

Full time employment needs to be the norm. Casualization has resulted in resulted in millions of insecure temporary jobs. People need real, dependable jobs to have happy healthy lives.

Access to Psychological counseling outside of work hours so people can get help without having to impact their work lives. There should be a lot of access on weekends and after 5 during the week.

Access to help should be targeted to the need, if someone needs weekly access for 3 years to heal then that is what they should get. 

All Australians need access to affordable housing, and all working Australian's should be able to buy their own homes. Renting is a big source of anxiety for a number of reasons, and restricts people's abilities to enjoy their homes, and have a pet. This is also vital so that people can have a family.

We need better pay and conditions for Australian workers in general. Workers are constantly asked to help the country by booting productivity, but are not being rewarded. We are asked to work overtime for free and to except poorly trained and cheap foreign labour under free trade agreements that only benefit miners and farmers.

We need to support all our industries so that we have a full variety of careers available in this country. More opportunities so people are not stuck doing a job they hate because there isn't enough work in what they are gifted at doing, what the excel at. This means finally investing in our industrial base and investing in our games and IT industries are other countries already do.

Better public health systems especially access to dental treatments.

Most importantly we need to acknowledged that Australia is a community made up of her people. We should endevor to uplift all of them to their fullest potential. So they can have pride in their contribution, live healthy lives with a family to call heir own.

In short I would put it down to fragmentation of services and lack of trust.

It might seem strange because there are so many programs and services, but I have no idea what services are available or how to access them.
Some seem to be private, some are private but receive state funding, some are state-run.
All have their own platforms, eligibility, and most importantly entry points- most seem useless.
I didn't even know a GP was an access point for mental health support.

Another issue that was important was that I move around a lot geographically and didn't have a personal relationship with anyone in health services- I would have to approach a total stranger.
I rarely saw a GP to begin with because my physical health is good, and when I did my local GP was foreign and botched a minor operation- which damaged my trust.
I removed stitches in my own home rather than return to the clinic
I heard a rumor the GP was replaced as the result of someone else's' complaint.

When I finally asked about anxiety almost a year later a new GP immediately gave me a prescription for anti-anxiety drugs without any discussion about their effects, a treatment plan- anything.
I was told to research the drugs he had just prescribed in my own time and not given any reliable resources. When I started taking the drugs I started having unexpected sexual problems, and didn't have the confidence/trust to talk to my GP about it because it was confusing at the time and personal.
As many people do I just didn't go back to the GP, I still have the box of pills years later.

Nobody wants to say it and even I don't feel comfortable raising the issue but some people in regional areas are fed up with the technical skills of the foreign doctors we get and we also regularly fail to communicate with them.
I personally experienced this both of the times I attempted to get support.
Sometimes it's their English skills but more often it's their lack of understanding about our culture-  the chance of a man in a regional area being literal and frank about a mental health issue is low if they even seek support to begin with.
It's not their fault, it's the fault of the system for failing to train and retain doctors in regional areas.
I had to spell out my problem to a total stranger far more frankly than I was comfortable with to even get him to understand I had a problem- and when the medication had sexual side effects there was no way I was going back to try and explain that to him.
It's a total can of worms, if you even mention it expect a broadside from your editor.

I also had concerns about the privacy and risk of abuse of the new digital and centralized government systems like Mygov.
I spent two hours trying to make sense of the privacy policy, it wasn't reassuring.
There seemed to be no concrete guarantee that physical/mental health records would be secure.

So there you go, a paranoid racist regional Australian- make of that what you will.
All I can say is that I'm far from the only one.","My problems weren't as bad as a lot of people's, really I'm just a dude.
But living with untreated anxiety problems caused me to struggle early on at school and later at work- eventually I started drinking heavily to try and manage which only made things worse.
As a result I moved around a lot and still don't have a GP or any connections in the health industry.
Instead of seeking help for anxiety; I'm now seeking help for alcohol abuse.
These problems seem common outside major cities and are only going to get worse with the virus.","I have read a number of your articles and would like to send words of encouragement.

As someone with more than 5 years of experience in the system, I try to help my peers access these services as best I can; get a separate medicare card, fill in this form, try to find a practitioner that you vibe with while not using up all your sessions. Make sure that you can successfully convince your GP that you *are* worthy of treatment and a referral, all within the 15-30 minute session that you've been given by a GP (nevermind whatever other health issues you need to talk about with your practitioner). That's not easy and already acts as a first deterrant to people trying to access these services.

The money has dried up, and many practitioners can only partially cover the cost of one session from the payment that is given by Medicare, with an ever widening gap payment that disproportionately affects those who need it most. My friends are from many marginalized groups in society (queer, poor, and POC) and are only just now starting to seek help for issues that require way more than 6 + 4 personalized sessions trying to find someone who will understand their issues, they can successful communicate with, all while paying a gap that could ostensibly go towards rent, food, physical medicine. 

Even if you are experienced with the system and have found a practitioner that you vibe well with, external referrals to further psychiatrists can feel like a game of telephone; use one of your subsidized session to ask your mental health practitioner to write a detailed report and referral to your GP, fax your GP your information and wait weeks to meet with your GP, so that your GP can fax and print *another* referral to a psychiatrist you have no experience with who is swarmed with patients and has a three month wait list for the next appointment, all for an *INTRODUCTORY SESSION*. We *could* speed things up by just directly going to the psychiatrist in lieu of a medicare referral that takes off only *some* of the cost, but that's a $300-500 p/h fee that many vulnerable neuro-atypical people seeking treatment can't afford.

Life doesn't stop for me, and my provisions from university can only do so much to alleviate my brain from its own mental fog that massively impedes me. I have had to deal all my life with my own mental health, but having to wait a few more months for something I've hashed out with my psychologist over 5 years, all because my referral is only valid for one specific practitioner, and if I want to see another practitioner I need to go through the system *again* to procure one golden ticket to a discounted session makes the system feel even more unwelcoming than it already is.","","Yes","","","","","","","","",""

.
I have since been to another GP who is covered by medicare who told me they were referring me to a psychologist who offered medicare covered sessions but when I rang to make the appointment their charge was $170 a session.  Again unaffordable.

I found that this process was so stressful, and given that I was already in a very fragile and stressed state, I was unable to continue to keep going back to doctors to try and get referrals to an affordable psychologist.

I've only now just started my own journey with psychology and even with the rebate I believe it's very expensive but that I'm a good enough financial position to be able to afford it. 

The other reason I would say that I never really sought to use a psychologist, even though I had considered it, was because as a cis-male you're expected to take most things on the chin and ""man-up"". It's not as if I'm not unaware of the benefits of psychology, but the stigma of it being something only ""sick and depressed people"" do, made it even less likely I'd use it.

Plus there is the social and professional stigma attached to mental health and the fact that I believe our society doesn't really address mental health as much as we should. For instance, I need to ensure I use a rostered day off, from work, to go to my psychologist. Also, I wouldn't even consider taking a day off work for mental-health reasons, even though I believe it's perfectly valid, so long as you can obtain medical cert.","I made the decision to seek professional help due to my apathy towards my overall quality of life.I feel, as I enter into my thirties, I have no real sense of direction and a growing desire to actually find some kind of clarity of what I want to do. I'm also using it to help improve the way I cultivate and maintain my relationships as I do not have the best social skills and feel a lot of this stems from my early development being somewhat stunted.

If I had not gone to a psychologist I had a very strong suspicion that as I grew older I would have become a lot more embittered over what my life has become and I would never work past the traumas and pains I've experienced, leading to even poorer mental health.

Despite having a genetic and lifelong disability that involves verbal communication challenges, and clear comorbid mental health issues such as depression and anxiety due to unaddressed needs, my GP consistently waits for me to initiate any mental health assessments or access to subsidised services. I see this as a failure on the training of GPs - they don't understand that initiating communication and discussion around mental health is difficult for some people, especially people with communication disability; and 2. Lack of accessible communication for people with disability (PWD): Even when I do get desperate enough to request access, the services that people such as I require are very specialised, and the fee gaps are far too unaffordable. People with communication disability can also take much longer to communicate needs and receive treatment, so 10 visits??? Often doesn't go very far. General counselling and psychology services rarely use accessible communication methods i.e., accommodations for people with communication and sensory disabilities. Further, there is low to no awareness of our specific communication needs and differences and/or difficulties expressing emotional and physical states. e.g., Telehealth via phone is great for some - but, for people like me, the other person cannot see me struggling to verbally communicate, so they often finish my sentences or continue talking when I haven't finished explaining or responding. It is really frustrating to see the level of free and subsidised medical and mental health services for able people, particularly now during the pandemic when access information appears almost everywhere. I would never call Lifeline, BeyondBlue etc purely based on access issues in verbal communication. People also underestimate the financial impact of disability in limiting access to (e.g.,) communication technologies and services. Things as simple as the Internet, PCs, tablets, assistive technologies, etc. and/or the education to use them can be unaffordable.","","Enormous - I have to rely on self-management, which is definitely not good for me or my family. I have struggled for many years, and the lack of access to equitable counselling and mental healthcare has resulted in chronic and very poor mental health PLUS increasing physical problems as a result of prolonged stress and maladaptive coping (e.g., alcohol abuse). The impacts are wide-ranging and compounding > if you can't function psychologically it is extremely difficult to maintain education, employment, and social connectivity. You feel like a burden on everyone, stuck in a cycle of despair, and it's difficult to sustain friendships when you feel compelled to mask how you feel and put on a happy face. It is soul destroying. I am sick of hearing people flippantly say things like ""Are you ok?"". I hate RUOK day. Do people really want an answer: ""No actually - my life sucks and here's why..."" Then the standard response is often ""Oh well, things could be much worse"" or ""Try to be more positive"" or ""Have you tried talking to someone?"" I know my life could be worse, so that statement is a kick in the guts and it's unhelpful. Positive psychology has been thoroughly debunked - hooray!; and I have explained why ""talking"" to professionals is not really a viable option for some people with communication and sensory disabilities.","The NDIS is failing to help many people with disability, but the general public often focus on a minority of families that are showcased as being very well supported. Inequitable access to mental healthcare through lack of awareness of accessible communication and accessible information, and lack of support via NDIS services, is something that able people will only understand if they ever have the misfortune to acquire a disability. That's our reality - very few people seem to genuinely care and even fewer act meaningfully to resolve our problems.","","","","","","","",30203,"Nundah","Major cities - medium SES"

There's also the cost of actually going to the GP to get the appropriate referrals and paperwork completed.


I first realised I needed help with my mental health struggles (major depression and general anxiety) about a decade ago, in my early 20s. At the time I was working full time and living at home (although paying board, but that's not the same as rent, utilities, etc etc) so I had the discretionary funds to see a non-bulk billing GP and psychologist; there don't appear to be any bulk billing psychs in the ACT. While I was still very ill I was cognizant that I needed help and that I would probably need to by my own advocate for the help I wanted.

Going to the GP (a doctor I'd not met before but part of a practice I'd been going to since birth) I was fully prepared to push for a psych referral instead of being ""fobbed off"" with a prescription and it left at that (like many with mental illness I thought that the issue was with me as a person, not a chemical imbalance that needed to be corrected; after 12+ months of therapy I was prescribed medication which has honestly saved my life). Luckily the doctor I saw that day was kind, empathetic, knowledgeable, and able to take the time to talk about what was going on and what kind of help I was after. He arranged for a referral to a psych that he thought I would get along with well (he was correct) and whose office was accessible via public transport. He made it clear that he was happy to provide a referral to another provider if the first didn't work out and that I should not be discouraged.

The system has worked for me; I have been able to access the professional assistance that care that I need at the right times. However, I know that a lot of that is related to the privilege I have; I was/am working full time with enough money to see a private practice GP and psychologist (even with Medicare rebate the out of pocket cost per psych appointment is $100+ still, prohibitive for a lot of people); I am white and female and do not face the same social or internalised stigma that many men and people of colour come up against when dealing with mental health issues; I was depressed and anxious but was not in the midst of a psychiatric emergency and so was able to advocate for myself and my care; being a typical Canberra girl of two public servant parents, and with a government-adjacent job myself, I know my way around a bureaucratic system.

If just one of these things had been different, if I'd had no money to spare, or got a harried doctor with no time to spare, or was less able to acknowledge or articulate how I was feeling, or access to mental health professionals was lacking (such as in many regional areas), or was just a lot sicker than I was with little support system, then I may not be here to write about it.

I rang the clinic to make an appointment. The receptionist was rude and dismissive as soon as I said that I needed to be bulk billed- and I had to be quite assertive insisting that as a DSP recipient I was entitled to be bulk billed. I waited about 3 weeks for an initial appointment with the first available therapist who bulk billed. When I had my first appointment I was disappointed to realise that the therapist was actually a social worker, rather than a clinical psychologist (I have a social work degree myself). The therapist seemed inexperienced and most of the time was spent with me filling in the same depression questionnaire I had filled in with my GP. The therapist spent most of the time telling me long rambling stories about his other patients. I  attended on another occasion and I was early. The receptionist was playing really loud hip-hop style music with lyrics about suicide- I asked her to turn the music down-she told me that she couldn't. I went to the bathroom and as I walked along the corridor I could clearly hear every word that another client was telling his therapist in another consulting room. I attended three times in total.

The trip there would take about an hour and a half on public transport. I waited about 6 weeks for an appointment. During that time I spoke to an acquaintence who said her experience of this clinic had been very bad-that the psychiatrist had seen her for only 15 minutes and had been very rude to her.

This time I had also ended up homeless. At first, access to a psychologist was not difficult, though the sessions felt like i was being treated like a teenager. I subsequently learned that it was the only psychologist available and was not well regarded. I was then sent home with vallium, and then run of the mill one size fits all anti depressants from the gp.
when i enquired about seeking psychiatric treatment to better manage any drugs they wanted to put me on, they told me i was attempting to hinder my own treatment and was non serious.
in subsequent months on vallium, attempted siucide and was finally referred to a psychiatrist.

in my experience with depression over the last 20 years it seems the only time access to adequate help is after a life threatening incident.
that is what gets in the way.
a system that denies real problems, and has little by way of funding for complex delivery. but plenty of court stuff, and plenty of after the fact stuff,.

I desperately wailed and screamed for help from my parents at the time. they were at a loss and called the police, after the next door neighbour had screamed out 'why dont you just kill yourself already'

I live in a small room in a boarding house. It is a beautiful building and I enjoy the company of people who also have trouble finding a way to be useful in today's cut throat capitalism. Being able to choose whether I interact or not makes a big difference to my mental health.

I've had anxiety since I was a child, and was fortunate to find out about the Better Health plan from my GP when I was doing VCE. However, I frequently only access about half to three quarters of my sessions for the year, due to the time and cost involved.","","It's hard to find time to visit a psychologist when you work full time, especially when your employer has a more ""hush hush"" approach to mental health: you don't feel comfortable explaining why you have all these appointments.

Then there's the gap between the subsidised amount and the full cost of the session, which is frequently $70 or more. Yes, there are psychologists who charge less, but they are frequently less experienced, or just plain less caring, as they're seeing too many patients, and are exhausted.

One particularly bad low cost psychologist went so far as to diagnose me with borderline personality disorder (an often quite stigmatising condition) twenty minutes into our first session, despite the fact that I lacked many of the key symptoms. I felt so overridden and misunderstood that I completely disassociated - I have no memory of the next few hours, until I found myself having a panic attack at home. I was scared to go back and see someone for months.

It might sound dramatic, but it just goes to show the consequences of trying to save money on something so personal and important.

That leaves you with seeing ""full cost"" psychologists. My current psych is great, but the gap encourages me to save the sessions for emergencies, rather than trying to treat things proactively.","","Yes","Yes","Yes","","","","",21103,"Maroondah","Major cities - medium SES"

When I did agree and then attend, my reluctance to admit I could not cope, hindered what the psychologist could advise and work with. The  6+ 4 sessions of the GPs mental health action plan was gobbled up in a few months. 

Medicare contributes to some of the cost of psychology sessions.

I could neither afford the time nor the cost for the ongoing sessions. A Medicare personel told me I should be medicated because if after 10 sessions I wasn't cured, then therapy wasn't working.

I paid for a handful of session with a miserly rebate for some, from Medibank. 

By this stage, I could only manage sporadic part-time work, and the cost of on-going psychological counselling was a cost that had to be included in my budgeting if I was to manage to keep suicidality in its place.

My sessions are organised around what times the psychologist works, and if I have work when she is available, then I have to forgo the session. I need the work to survive.

I see a psychologist out of my local area. I do not want my neighbours, colleagues, friends knowing I was seeing, and still need to see a psychologist. No matter how much is said about 'no more stigma' about having a mental health issue; it is a fallacy. The stigma remains and impacts how work colleagues construe one's fitness for work.

I now  manage with 6-10 sessions a year but remain fearful, especially during Covid times, that if I lose the part-time work I have and if circumstances trigger another episode of suicidality, the allocation of 10 sessions may not be sufficient to keep me this side of the cliff.","","When the initial 10 sessions had been used up, I paid for the ongoing sessions, spacing them as far apart as I could manage - both financially and psychologically. It was a dance of chancing that nothing would tip the balance.
This heightened the level of anxiety I experienced, an additional layer (or dance partner) with managing suicidality.

I do not know if, by extending the duration of access to sessions hindered or delayed my capacity to manage, but I do remember that I became curious about why mental health received so little government funding.","My experience of inadequate mental health services led me to do academic research which considers non-medicated approaches to managing suicidality.

My experience of suicidality was linked to my sense of spirituality. This is a key reason I came to research the topic.

I eventually got fed up with her attitude and the high cost of regular appointments that didn't seem to be getting me any better meant that I dropped the talking therapy part of my mental health treatments. Unfortunately that experience left me feeling reluctant to try it again - especially after various family members had their own poor experiences with finding suitably compassionate psychologists.
I ended up having a major depressive episode before I was lucky enough to stumble upon a psychologist who was both local, affordable, and her therapy style worked really well for me.","","Cost was a huge factor that played on my mind a lot of the time. The rebate was pathetic when I first started, and I was often left $100 out of pocket, which is a lot of money for a single woman in their 20s and 30s to afford when trying to pay all the other bills.

The next biggest factor was the fear of not finding a psychologist whose therapy style doesn't work for you personally. There is a disturbing lack of empathy shown by some counsellors/psychologists/psychiatrists. It can be difficult to build rapport and trust with someone who dismisses some of your feelings because they want to move on from a recurring issue that bothers you. (this latter experience was my mother's with a counsellor/psychologist under the Better Health system). 

Location played a reasonable amount of importance, as well as time. I'm fortunate that my current psychologist has certain days in which an after-work hours appointment can be booked. I don't want to have to take personal leave to attend routine appointments that I need in order to function like other human beings. Though mental health stigma is slowly becoming better, it's still not something I'm comfortable with colleagues, managers or my workplace knowing about unless it's directly affecting my work.","The recent covid-necessitated switch to telehealth psychology appointments have been a blessing.

I have finally recognised this is important and without help I may not survive so I am deliberately prioritising this despite it not being financially that viable especially as the anxiety medication I take is not PBS supported either (around $70/4wks). When I was younger, this was a massive deterrent. The stigma means I've only recently accepted (on good days) medication is OK, therapy is OK rather than a sign of failure. Previous therapists that were not the right fit also did not help and deterred me, there is not enough public education to inform that it's OK to change therapist, therapy only works of the patient trusts the therapists - cultural sensitivity is essential to provide a safe space (I've had one psychologist basically just read pamphlets to me; I've recently realised that having a POC therapist has made a huge difference to my outcome as previous non-POC could not or would not understand my lived experience, a lot of my trauma has been racism related including the abusive relationship I was in) . 10 sessions is not enough for people who have been through trauma, I'm privileged enough to still be able to afford sessions monthly (though maybe not for too long) , but it's not quite enough.

Looking back, I needed help a lot sooner, a lot of trauma has been relived through lockdown, the BLM etc. I am lucky I got through it. 10 sessions may not even be enough to find the right therapist.

Some sessions dealing with trauma can retraumatise as talking about it means reliving the trauma. I have had to spread sessions out to monthly due to my 10 limit being reached, I am still finding myself not coping well in between as it's not enough. 50 minutes x 10 is not enough to try and understand the root of the trauma, let alone find coping strategies and tackling the problem.

I didn't know that I needed to or how to seek culturally safe therapy. I was in therapy whilst in an abusive relationship and the therapist did not recognise the  gaslighting my ex was doing to me, instead supported my ex and made me feel like it really was me. There were racial elements to that abusive relationship, they were not able to understand that either. I was with my ex for 4.5 years, I briefly saw a POC therapist who recognised these elements and started the domino effect (still took over a year) fo me to get away from that relationship. Ironically, had it been recognised sooner, I would not be requiring so much therapy now. My ex was the one that told me I needed therapy as a means of gaslighting, having the therapist validate that just made things so much worse.

I eventually stopped going because the combination of the financial burden stress, being asked too many times to go on medication and having to ‘ration out’ the 10 sessions for the year got too much to manage. I was ‘on the mend’ and decided to continue on my own without the support and hoped that someone else would be able to benefit like I did by giving up my bookings.

It’s weird because access to the initial sessions literally saved my life. But 10 sessions a year is not enough fans to continue to get the support I needed was not an option for a number of reasons. Which just put me back at higher risk of panic attacks and ending up suicidal again.

I fear that if I use all my sessions in the first half of the year, I might struggle a lot later in the year if I need help again or face a mental health crisis. I cannot understand why there is a limit on subsidized mental health sessioms. Mental health is as important as physical health. If we don’t have a limit on how many times we can claim a rebate for seeing a GP, then why do we have a limit for the number of times we can see a psychologist? Another issue is the large out of pocket cost. The rebate should be increased to align with the increasing costs charged by psychologists. Also, it is nearly impossible to find any psychologist that would bulk billed.

It's about being able to access appropriate providers who fit well with you and have appropriate experience and skills to meet your specific needs.

This may require seeing a number of people.

Presently there are many barriers for this. Enormously high first consult costs, difficulty getting appointments, difficulty even finding out which providers exist and what services they offer.

Schemes that require you to be referred to one specific provider and stick to that are not going to meet patient needs.

Schemes that direct patients toward basic service providers, often junior, may simply be wasteful if a given patient has already exhsustively explored those paths. There's no point sending someone with bipolar, schizophrenia, BPD or CPTSD to a clinical psychologist to do some generic CBT work oriented toward anxiety management. It's just a waste and worse it will cost the patient the opportunity to see a more appropriate provider. They lose the time, the gap costs, the subsidy access, and they may not even know they need to see a different kind of provider.

Mental health plans and the better access program have never been widely available for the bulk of counselling services - previous counsellors have told me they were either not eligible to register or found the process of registration too difficult to navigate and update. The rebate from a mental health plan covers only part of the cost of most sessions, and if you see a psychologist rather than a counsellor or social worker the cost even after the rebate is prohibitive. For adequate mental health treatment 10 sessions of individual therapy is vastly inadequate, and the availability and quality of group services is not nearly enough to meet demand. When accessing mental health services, the last thing a suffering and often severely debilitated person needs is to jump through hoops - locating a therapist who offers care using the rebate plan, as well as meeting the clients financial and therapy needs (which requires either out of pocket expense, or the use of one of the ten rebates sessions), then finding a GP to refer them. Asking a severely depressed person to deal with bureaucracy to access care may be the definition of ‘cruel and unusual’.  GP’s largely have absolutely no idea how or where to refer a person suffering mental health issues, and a 15 minute appointment isn’t an adequate time to make the kind of rapport that would enable a GP to understand the needs of the person they’re referring. Over more than 20 years of treatment for chronic depression (dysthymia), and complex trauma, I have accessed the mental health rebate only twice, and paid upward of forty thousand dollars out of pocket for psychotherapy, trauma oriented therapy and counselling. The amount I’ve paid has been low in comparison with others, because counsellors have often offered me a sliding scale for payment (which came out of their pocket- another blow to professional women in caring roles), and because I have often gone without therapy I badly needed because the stress and cost of access was too high.","The healing I finally got took twenty years instead of perhaps 5 or 10. The stress of living in ongoing financial hardship because I was using my income to pay for essential health services rather than to save (for example, for a home deposit or retirement) or to live well, has been immeasurable. My financial situation and professional life has also been impacted severely by having to invest my energy in staying stable and paying for services, rather than in investing my time and energy in a career, family, or financial security. Without adequate mental health support, it has taken me fully ten to fifteen years to reach a level of professional achievement that would be normal for a recent graduate.","Mental health services urgently need to be included in Medicare. Comprehensively. We’re letting people suffer, fail to flourish, and all too often die because we’re worried about the financial fallout of care.

The schools I attended also did not provide them with support to get me that help so I bumbled along as an anxious kid and teen without sound developmental support, which tracked well into adulthood.

As an adult, I realised my anxiety was not normal, but fear of stigma around being branded ""mentally ill"" held me back from accessing help that I needed for years. 

I finally found the courage to seek help when I was in my 30s and mostly well, however, even then, cost was a challenge as I was studying, but my family assisted, knowing it was necessary and very long overdue.

The following year, after a relationship breakdown, my anxiety was out of control and I knew I needed to go back to my psychologist. I had just changed GP clinics, and saw a new GP and asked for a new referral. I was told it couldn't be done as I should have booked a longer appointment. I got the obligatory ""are you going to kill yourself"" question and was told as long as I wasn't going to kill myself then I could wait until another time and book the correct, longer, more expensive appointment. I was humiliated - the intimation to an anxious person was that they'd done the wrong thing, and should have been smarter about seeking help. At a time when I was incredibly raw and fragile, just asking for that referral had taken every ounce of courage I had, and I was so rudely denied it. The doctor eventually relented and gave me my referral, but made sure I knew it was taking up his valuable time and was a great inconvenience.","","Although these access schemes weren't in place when I was a child, not seeing a psychologist as a child/teen damaged my confidence throughout my adult life - it's impacted confidence, resilience, strategising through challenges, you name it. While I'm happy I've done good work NOW, it's been a lot harder and a lot longer than it could have been if I'd had good support as a kid instead of going it alone.

Also, I was super lucky to have good rapport with my chosen psych from day 1, but I know so many people who don't build good rapport with the first therapist they find, and then think they can't find others - there needs to be much better support around having the opportunity to find a therapist you can work with. 10 visits is bugger all if it takes 4-5 different appointments to find a good therapist you can work with, and 10 visits with a professional you don't connect with can be even more damaging than getting no help at all.","Sorry I haven't given you my details.

I also know there are loads of people out there FAR worse off than I am so please give their stories voice if they give them to you.

Also, not related to my story directly, but from my own professional experience:
The NDIS supports around mental health are WOEFUL - the scheme will accept people with mental health disabilities, then try to palm them off to the MHCP, citing that 10 visits is sufficient, even when their conditions require much more intensive intervention (and it's evidence-based that they need intensive therapy). It's disgusting and discriminatory.

Lastly, I work in healthcare, and I see lack of resources on so many fronts, including for many different professionals who don't know how to engage with someone who discloses a mental health concern - it's not part of the training for so many health professions, yet any one of us can build enough rapport with someone that they trust us enough to disclose their problems to us.

Alternatively, they do not offer good options to someone like me who can't drive or use public transport for - ironically - severe PTSD / mental health reasons. 

* Lack of competence dealing with chronic disability of any kind, and chronic pain. I find that people on a standard Australian psychology curriculum are woefully out of their depth with complex-PTSD, as well as chronic pain and chronic fatigue issues. A lot of time is spent educating them, and knowing they won't further educate themselves in many cases. Given the comorbidity of depression and anxiety with common chronic pain issues, this seems like an incredible oversight in the current Australian psychology curriculum. 

* Lack of competence when dealing with LGBTQIA+ issues, particularly relating to asexuality and being nonbinary. Some therapists are getting better with this, but many are booked out for weeks to months, or not taking new clients, exactly because there's a shortage and it shows. Some therapists are even clearly homophobic, or you have to educate them as to why they're being phobic, which obviously isn't helpful when trying to access support and feeling like you can trust the person you're speaking to.

* One of my registered Clinical Psychologists who is still practicing, abused me and talked openly about swinger's parties that she'd attended and then would talk about touching me to fix my aversion to touch at the time, in a way that was intrusive and didn't pay attention to my consent levels. I terminated therapy with her, afraid and spiralling, and had no idea who I could go to or talk to in order to report her. It is extremely easy for psychologists to abuse patients, and we are rarely believed, because of course we have the mental illnesses. :( It took a long time to trust any therapist after this, and I stopped seeing Clin Psychs and started only seeing counsellors and psychotherapists - after this, I stopped using the Better Access program. 

Other psychologists just seemed truly callous. At a time when I was at my lowest and unable to work, a psychologist through the Medicare scheme asked me to imagine just one job I could see myself doing. I said data entry, as I can type quickly and I thought I could do it at home. Immediately, and angrily, she said: 'DON'T BE STUPID, you're too smart for that, you should want to be a manager! That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard' She ignored the fact that I have never wanted to be a manager (even at my healthiest), and projected her own ideals onto me, and berated my intelligence at the same time. It was my last session with her, and I cried on the way home, feeling stupid and like I wasn't smart enough to figure out what kind of job I should want for myself. She's still working through the Medicare scheme in Perth. 

One psychologist, upon hearing that I'd been sexually assaulted as a child in Princess Margaret Hospital said: 'That didn't happen. Children don't get abused in places like that.' Never mind that it was actually a huge controversy for some decades - that it children *were* abused in places like that and it went under the radar for so long. I was unable to talk about this abuse for another few years with other therapists because I was afraid they would simply tell me my experience hadn't happened. It baffles me to this day that someone who works as a psychologist genuinely thinks that children can't be taken advantage of in hospitals, and that her immediate response was to tell me that those kinds of things don't happen in children's hospitals, or in Western Australia. She's still working through the Medicare scheme in Perth. I wouldn't even consider her a bad psychologist, just incredibly, incredibly naive. 

* Cost. Even taking into account Medicare's assistance, and being on the Disability Pension, it's just too prohibitively expensive on a Disability Pension. Not only that, but you may need to look for more than one therapist if you have complex issues (which is common, not uncommon), and that becomes more prohibitively expensive over time. 

* Limits. You only have a limited pool of specialists to deal with, and many of the best or more effective are booked up or not taking new clients. If you're in a semi-rural suburb like I am, the limits become more imposing. I have never been able to find a local specialist to help me, I am always looking outside of my suburb, despite the suburb having a population of around 50,000 people. 

* Amount of sessions. 10 sessions might be enough to help someone who is simply looking to change a job or find a way to communicate with a partner in a generally healthy but struggling relationship, but I don't believe it's enough to deal with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, domestic violence, Battered Wife Syndrome, and other serious mental illnesses. It seems cruel to expect people with mental illnesses to get better in 10 hours worth of therapy, just because the government won't help out with more. It also leads to people victim blaming people with mental illnesses when they don't get better in the limited amount of time that they have. That is not a failure of the patient, that is a failure of the system.","","Increased suicidal ideation and suicide planning, causing significant distress for me and my friends and family. Inability to work, socialise or function, including caring for myself by providing food or maintaining a decent sleep schedule. In some cases, especially due to uncaring or at worst, abusive therapists, there was significant backsliding in all of my therapeutic progress, and a need to pay out of my own pocket to heal from abuse that had been done to me by a previous psychologist. Even uncaring or unsympathetic, bigoted psychologists who are queerphobic can do immense damage by implying that your sexuality is a mental illness, or suggesting that the way you live the best parts of your life - that you enjoy the most - are damaging simply because they don't want to understand gender dysphoria or gender expression.","I have multiple complex health issues and I receive some of the world's best care for some of them through the public health system, such as when I had cancer treatment two years ago. I am still incredibly grateful for that. I'm also cognizant of the fact that my case is complex, but I've learned after two mostly frustrating decades that there are incredible mental health professionals out there; just not most of the Clinical Psychologists through the Better Access Program that I've seen. And many were reluctant to admit they were not equipped to help me, which could have saved us both time.

I would like to acknowledge that while psychotherapy and counselling and social work is often put down by psychologists, it has provided clear, functional assistance for me in a way that now allows me to work part-time while on Disability, and manage my own finances, and advocate for myself as a patient with pride. 

But therapy and psychology and mental health care in Australia and Western Australia is still incredibly backwards, limited, and even damaging. 10 sessions per patient is not enough, and a limited support pool of often booked up specialists leaves some of the most desperate and marginalised patients with some of the worst or least effective psychologists. It easily damages patients as often as it helps them, and having doctors telling you to see a therapist isn't having any of the tools to begin to afford to see one, be able to get there, or find the hours for someone else to get there, or to even see one in a timely manner due to wait-lists. 

It's taken me years to learn how to effectively self-advocate for myself and I'm lucky to be able to do this, as not everyone is in a place with their mental illnesses to manage it. I try and share what I can with people new to therapy in Perth, since I do still believe in its ability to help people, but I'm also realistic about what say, a young LGBTQIA+ person is likely to be dealing with if they can't specifically find another LGBTQIA+ psychologist.

When it works, it works, and I believe I am doing as well as I am in part due to the incredible counsellors and psychotherapists I have seen (not psychologists though, at best, they have not harmed me further - I'm sure there are good Clinical Psychologists out there, but having seen 15 of them - at least 4 or 5 through Better Access care plans, I've definitely given up on that line of things).","Yes","Yes","Yes","","","","",50403,"Swan","Major cities - medium SES"

When my mental health was at it's worst I was agoraphobic, was not taking care of my ADLS, my house was unkempt, I was living on home delivery and I didn't talk to anyone. I was suicidal and was eventually seen as a voluntary patient in a mental health hospital.

I have said many times that my struggle with mental health was far harder than my brain caner, and my brain caner will eventually kill me. I want to say that again because I think it's very important. My anxiety / depression was significantly worse than the brain cancer that will kill me.

I had to wait more than 6 months for an appointment for myself to see a psychologist under a care plan.  I think I was given 5 sessions.   To get more I will need to wait, again.   I deal with the stress of being the carer for my husband who has a lifetime of mental health issues including bipolar, and autism spectrum issues.    When we moved to Tasmania he had to wait 18 months to get into a psychiatrist, despite having been seeing one regularly in Victoria for 20 years.  Then we moved house, still in Tasmania,  and he referred us to a colleague closer (in Burnie).  That was another wait of more than a year for an appointment, through which time he was self-medicating.  His GP was writing scripts for whatever dosage he asked for.   By the time he saw the psychiatrist he was manic, (predictably), and went on and on in the manic episode. (I was present at that appointment, at Dr's request).   The Dr said, You are not listening to me, I don't want you as a patient so go away.    He now self-doses, and his GP keeps writing scripts.    Its very challenging to live with, and at this stage I have no options left to me.","","My husband is often depressed, irritable, very difficult to negotiate with, or alternatively is mildly manic, impatient irritable and difficult.     The quality and availability of GP care is poor to moderate on the NW Coast of Tasmania and there appears to be a serious lack of mental health professionals.  In a lifetime of caring for a number of friends and family members, I haven't experienced this low level of care before.  Our GP provides husband with valium on request, but when I asked for a low level sleeping aid for me, (temazapan) he declined on the basis that I just needed to de-stress.  When I said I wanted to discuss my options for that he said I had had my 10 minutes, and he was running a business, not a charity, and to make another appointment.  (I did, it took 2 weeks for another appointment, where I insisted, and got my prescription..) Charming.    My husband has mental health and physical health issues also and I am his carer, so both of us are rather stuck with the situation, and I feel vastly unsupported.","I have never heard of that program that you refer to, but when I saw the psychologist 3 years ago it was under some sort of care plan, but it limited me to 5? sessions.  I asked for those sessions, and my GP provided the referral, but I had to find the psychologist, the GP didn't have anyone he referred to.   

The plan is useless if there are no professionals to actually see.    I would love to have 10 sessions with someone to develop some strategies for my mental health but despite regularly discussing my concerns about my husband my stress in dealing with him, etc nothing has been offered to me.

The biggest barrier of my clients once they receive the 10 session plan per year is that the number of sessions is not enough for moderate to severe cases. The govt. made some inroads recently with granting 40 sessions for people with Eating Disorders but presently people who are suicidal, have BPD, PTSD, sever Depression, severe Anxiety conditions such as OCD or addictions can only access 10 sessions per calendar year which is nowhere near enough. On the flip side, clients can see Psychiatrists for up to 50 sessions a year. This Medicare preference for pharmaceutical interventions over psychological therapy is doing a disservice to those who are battling mental health conditions but don't want to be dependnt on taking drugs, many of which have dubious research behind them and the possibility of debilitating side effects. If the govt. diverted some of the Psychiatry funding across to allied mental health through Better Access we would have better mental health outcomes here in Australia. Unfortunately Julia Gillard amd Kevin Rudd, when PM, were lobbied by Ian Hickie and Pat McGorry, Psychiatrists, to reduce the number of Better Access sessions from 14 to 10 for allied mental health. When it was 14 sessions research showed overwhelming positive psychological outcomes for the Better Access programme. Julia Gillard, as a result of this heinous anti-psychology lobbying by the psychiatrists, reduced the sessions allowed from 14 to 10. This was a travesty beyond comprehension. Unfortuantely the Pharmaceutical/Psychiatry lobby has huge power in this country and continue to influence Medicare funding for mental health so that the flow of money goes into their own coffers. What needs addressing here is that there has never been any research into the mental health outcomes of pateints utilising the Psychiatric Medicare Item Numbers. On the other hand, when Better Access for alliend mental health stood at 14 sessions, mental health outcomes were researched and shown to be significantly positive. Health Minister Greg Hunt is very much aware of this but continues to underfund Better Access while supporting the coffers of Psychiatry and Ian Hickies Headspace which has benefited from 100s of millions of dollars for a system that has shown to have poor outcomes with 70% of clients not benefiting.

now that i have a soul sucking office job (that makes me more miserable with every passing day), a license, and im not being as closely monitored by my parents, i can actually take an hour or 2 out from work to go see my counsellor again, (i actually have once in the past year, it was great). But now the main thing preventing me from going to my counsellor again is that i dont want to burn through my 10 subsidised sessions, and that a majority of my mental health issues come from the fact that im living in a terrible home environment that actively makes me more and more depressed hopeless with every passing year.

that, and occasionally i feel so hopeless that i feel like going to these sessions wont matter because im doomed to be forced into a life my parents want me to live, instead of what i dream to do with my life.","","back when i was still seeing my counsellor, it felt amazing because i could speak to someone that would understand what i was going through, how i felt, and actively expressed encouragement for my creative hobbies (the only thing that makes me happy and gives me purpose), and actively encouraged me and reassured me that i would be able to take those creative hobbies further in tertiary education, or in a future career (which i so desperately wanted to the point where it was my one reason for living when i was suicidal in highschool).

when my mum announced that i shouldnt ever be going back there, and that there was ""nothing wrong with me, and the counsellors lying about my mental illness and autism just so that they make more money from appointments"", it felt like i was being closed off, and forced back into a constant environment around my parents where ill just be constantly put down, have everything that makes me happy be mocked, be pushed into careers and life choices i straight up do NOT want, and ill just have to accept it.

and honestly its really put me in a shitty mindset about how nothing in life will ever go well for me, and im doomed to be miserable, and im doomed to be stuck with people that will make me miserable because ""thats just how life is, and if you actively try to 'improve your situation' by not conforming to expectations of those around you, then theres something seriously wrong with you","bruh i dont even fuckign know, ive been working on a plan with my counsellor since last year to get OUT of my parents house so i dont ever have to deal with those manipulative bastards again. and the sooner i get out, the better, every single life choice they try to make for me makes me more and more depressed and suicidal by the day, holy f u c k.

that being said, when i do eventually get out, i get VERY worried about financial stability, and whether i will be able to have a roof over my head, something to eat every day, and being able to actually pursue my dream course and career. ESPECIALLY when it is a nightmare to get financial aid from places like centrelink, i especially fear that any application i do make will be rejected like last time because im not 'autistic enough', when so many hardships in my life have been a direct result of my autism.

i try staying hopeful by thinking that sooner or later, im getting my depressed autistic ass out of there, and in a better place where i actually get to do what i love for a living, and im surrounded by people that actually appreciate me and love me for who i am for once but....like...im still scared that it wont go according to plan yknow.","","","","","","","","","",""

Then the session ended. He didn't complete the form.

I tried again with a second GP, he lost his temper when I couldn't describe my signs and symptoms of my anxiety, because I needed a definition between the two. Easy with physical discomforts, not psychological. But he filled out the form. 

However, the Medical Centre admin did not fill out the right paperwork. So I couldn't get a rebate for my first three sessions with a psychologist. I applied for the rebate online, but Medicare rejected the applications with an A4 page containing just one line stating I was ineligible because of ""550"". There was no reference to what that meant. 
Eventually I received 2 of 3 rebates. My mental health took a dive before my third application and I still haven't followed it up.

There were only three sessions with the Psychologist because in the third session I asked her for different coping tools than the ones she had recommended. She asked me if I 'looked after myself' or had any body image issues. I was looking after myself, and of course I had body image issues but I hadn't raised them myself and they had absolutely nothing to do with the trauma I was seeking help to cope with. After a bit of coaxing she was able to get a reply from me about my physical insecurities and she recommended I get breast surgery. I cancelled the rest of my appointments.

Most recently I tried again to get a mental health plan. The GP printed out the questions for me to answer myself at home. And I've found I can't do it. It's too confronting. 

In any case, I've since moved to Canberra and I haven't been able to find an affordable psychologist that does not leave me $150 out of pocket per session. I'm not a public servant so this over my budget for the week.

I can only imagine what would have happened in all of these circumstances if I wasn't feeling OK at the time. It's scary that it can be so difficult to get help. It feels like the system favours the rich.","","My PTSD has worsened and I'm now struggling with depression. Which sounds like every mental health 'awareness' pitch you've ever read. But what this means is that I still don't have the tools to cope with my emotions as they come up. 
Since that last unhelpful psychologist session I've been experiencing a very difficult grieving where the death of a loved one has resulted in an increase of PTSD symptoms which are difficult to stop. It's dangerous when I'm driving, or climbing, or doing anything where I need to be in the present moment. 
It's hard to get out of bed, and it's hard to go to bed. And it's especially difficult to talk to friends or family about it because I haven't learnt how to, from a professional psychologist.

In a new city with almost no support network, psychological help would be invaluable. 

The fallout is:
- that I'm losing my job because I can't access the right advice on how to deal with a bad workplace, while dealing with all my other thoughts. 
- I feel that I might have lost a good friend or two because I've over-burdened them with my issues. 
- I don't feel motivated anymore, I don't feel like me, and that's probably the worst.","Yes. A year ago I was suicidal. I don't think anyone knows this, but I'm not giving you my real name anyway.

Which I'm grateful for. But at some point I became terrified when I felt my impulse would overrun whatever was left of my rational voice. And at that point I called Lifeline. 

I wish I could remember the name of the woman I talked to. She sounded older, she was very patient. We came up with a plan to fix the situation I was in, together. I followed it. That woman was definitely my lifeboat.

4.

Then she went overseas and is now in Sydney. Because there was no government plan I paid what I could in conjunction with my health insurance. It must have cost me a fortune. By the time she went away, I was doing ok. But later, I began to slide back into depression (due to ill health). In more recent times, on the scheme (originally just 5 sessions) I went to various different psychologists referred by my GP at the time, and but never clicked with any of them. One psychologist, said ""Oh, you are just the sort of person I like to work with"". She was full of things she was going to do, but actually did nothing. More recently, I was referred to another psychologist who was very nice, very interested, but again did nothing. In all cases the psychologists never really asked any questions that would actually delve into my issues - why I was unsettled, confused, unsure of myself, perpetually in pain and lacking 'get up and go'.

I think one of the reasons why GPs don't always know of good specific psychologists is that they are unaware of which psychologist is specialised in which area, which is partly the fault of the way psychologists advertise.

Mental health can get worse, and a number of subsidised visits have already been used up before progress has been made.

1. Was due to finances and the inability to be able to afford even just the gap fee.

2. Was due to many psychologists having had closed their books due to having too many clients  and therefore not taking new clients on.

3. A third reason as to why accessing psychologists can be hard is due to the area in which you live not having the right skill set or knowledge in specialised areas of mental health to be able to help clients learn skills to better cope with life. 

An example is for Borderline personality disorder Dialectical behaviour therapy is the main source of treatment however for many people living with this disorder they need to find psychologists who know what this is and know how to help clients with this condition.

It's similar with childhood trauma and dissociative identity disorder. There needs to be more of a variety of people who specialize in areas and have more knowledge of treatment options in order to help people with disorders such as these.","","The fallout for me meant that I ended up back in hospital, it meant I went from psychologist to psychologist trying to find the one skilled enough to help me. It meant that I had come to the point of feeling like I was never going to get better and that no one was able to help me I was too damaged.

For alot of other people they try one or two and then see themselves as not being able to be helped. 

For others they give in feeling like trying to find the right help as too hard.

The financial burden even for the gap is real, at the moment I'm only able to see a psychologist because I know have ndis and because before I got ndis my psychologist decided to completely gullible me as I was cancelling appointments due to not even being able to afford the gap fee. 

I believe that if a person can be so mentally unwell that they can end up doing things that could see them in harm's way, why does it then make sense to charge people to see someone to help make them better? 

When an emergency happens in a hospital we don't always have to have the finances to pay for necessary surgeries so why does it make sense to make them pay for their mental wellbeing.

This could happen two, three, maybe more times before you find a psychologist you have a rapport with and feel you can trust. Meanwhile, you've burned at least six of your sessions and had to recount your story over and over again to perfect strangers.

Getting a single or multiple appointments weekly is difficult, and usually these aren't at a regular weekly timeslot. I was not working at the time so I was more flexible in fitting in with the psychologist availabilities, otherwise I might have only seen them once every few weeks. You could also be waiting weeks or months for a first available appointment. If I was needing as many appointments as I did then now while working full time, I could see this being very difficult without flexibility of work commitments. These long waiting times has definitely made me reconsider phoning up to make an appointment in the past, because when you need help right now a week can feel like forever.  

But before even finding a psychologist, asking your GP for a referral was one of the hardest steps for me. Because it's admitting you need help to someone else, and probably a majority of the time, a perfect stranger. So having a good relationship with your GP is very important, you need to feel comfortable to discussing these extremely personal issues openly. I have know my GP since before I was even born, so they have seen everything that has been wrong with me other the years. But even still, it was still a hard and awkward conversation to have. Plus you only have 10-15mins to talk about it with them before you are push out the door. Finding the confidence as soon as you walk into the GP consultation to say, hi, I need help because all of these personal things have, or are happening to me and it's debilitating, I don't know what to do: it is very hard but important step on the road to recovery. 

Also, getting access to only 10 subsidised individual sessions makes me think now what's the point. I'll need way more than that and I just can't afford it. For some I'm sure 10 is enough, but when you are just starting your treatment 10 sessions can be eaten up in under two months and achieve very little.

Cost is another significant issue.

Last year I had an acute experience of mental illness. My university offers up to six free sessions with a university counsellor, so I booked in for one of those when things started to get out of hand. It was very hard to get a booking, and I was advised to wake up at 6.30am to get an emergency booking - a little difficult when part of one's experience of mental illness involves difficulty getting out of bed in the morning. 

After one session, the uni psychologist referred me to the university GP for a mental health care plan, and she then referred me to an external psychologist. I was on a waiting list for this external psychologist for about 11 weeks before I got a place. 

By the time I got to see the new psychologist, I had simply had to work through the issues for which I had originally sought mental health care. If I hadn't done so then I would have been in a very bad state by the time help was available. The psychologist repeatedly asked me why I was there and what I was hoping to get out of the sessions with him, making it clear that he didn't feel I had a sufficient reason to be there. I felt the same, and had to keep reminding myself that I had been pretty significantly suicidal for a several weeks, just three months before. When I started to tell him about these issues he told me I was clearly a very emotional person and was clearly prone to excessive outbursts of emotion. Then he asked me again what I was seeking help for. After three sessions with him I gave up. 

I am a university student. I live away from my parents and have supported myself through university for the past 6 years. I do receive youth allowance, but this only covers my rent so I have to work to afford food, transport, uni expenses and medical care. However, I'm limited in how much I can work by the Centrelink payment thresholds. If I worked more, the payments would be cut off, and I'd have to do a hell of a lot more hours to make up for it. So, a catch-22 situation emerges where I'm stressed by my workload, which feeds into my mental illness, but I can't earn enough to fund proper mental health care. This is a system where you strive all you can but just never get ahead.

I've been obliged to seek bulk-billing options while studying, possibly at a time in my life when I've most needed good care. I would gladly pay for mental health care if I could - I will certainly be happy to if I ever need to see a psychologist when I start working full time. When I think about my experience of mental health care as a low income person, I think the situation is pretty alarming. I have been very lucky to be supported by friends and family, and have not been prevented from working and studying long-term by my mental illness. This comes from a certain level of privilege, which many many others in Australia do not have. Mental health care needs URGENT funding and better training for those working in the field.","I used to have a lot more faith in counseling and psychologists. I've stopped accessing treatment recently because I don't think the options that I can afford have much value. There are two main reasons for this: lack of continuity of care and poor quality care when it is available. 

The way that mental health care is funded, especially for people with a low income like me, you end up being shunted from one person to another. They ask the same questions again and again, and you have to tell the story of everything that happened up to that point to give each new mental health care worker enough context to offer meaningful advice and care, or refer you on to the next person. This adds a lot of stress and strain at a point which is usually pretty acutely bad (obviously  bad enough that you're seeking mental health care). 

I think this experience speaks to a broader issue which I have often encountered in mental health care. When I was first seeking treatment a few years ago, my original psychologist placed a strong emphasis on building my personal support networks - seeking support from family and friends and asking for help when I needed it. This was how I discovered that my parents are reliable people to talk to in a crisis, and how I also found that many of my former friends were not able to help me in the way my psychologist had told me they would. They didn't want to have anything to do with me when I told them I was struggling. 

Almost everyone I have spoken to when things have been tough for me has said the same thing: 'I think you should speak to someone about this - why not reach out to (*insert family/friends/counsellor/psychologist* here) and get some help?' I've been told to go off on my own and 'have a good cry' or, worst of all, have been totally cut out by that person. 

I think all Australians are implicated in this issue. We need to get better at supporting our friends and family who are living with mental illness, and not just telling them to speak to a professional and vice versa. Professional mental health care needs to be better resourced so that there is continuity of care. 

I have become self-reliant when it comes to mental health care, because I have repeatedly found I can't access support when I need it. It took a lot to ask for help in the first place, and frankly it's pretty uncertain whether or not it will pay off. This is a tough and scary process, and I still sometimes worry that one day the safety net I have built for myself might not be enough to keep me safe.","Hmmm... this isn't an answer to this question but I just noticed that I have to 'opt-in' to anonymity","A handful of people know about my mental illness. I've seen and experienced enough stigma to want to keep it that way. That's why I want to remain anonymous. 

That's a luxury though. Mental illness, especially at the level at which it affects my life, is a largely invisible disability. Disability isn't about what impairment a person has anyway, it's constructed by society. It's manifested in society's treatment of a person and the barriers placed around them. I never publicly talk about my experience of mental illness, not because I'm ashamed of it, but because I know that for some unfortunate people it will permanently affect the perceived legitimacy of anything else that I say.

It's amazing what people will say to you about others if they think that you're not part of the group they're talking about. Once the HR manager at my workplace (not in Australia luckily) told me about all the ""crazies"" (with Bipolar Disorder) he had seen walking around on the streets when he visited New York. 

I've lost people by telling them about my mental illness. By not disclosing it I can call people out for expressing unkind opinions about mental illness and offer them a more understanding viewpoint, without risking more hurt to myself. Of course what I tell them is strongly informed by my own experience, but they don't need to know that. I've found people are far more willing to be gently educated by someone they view as a peer than by someone they think of as being from that 'other' group. I recognize that it would be really powerful for me to actually tell people - to show them that the person they see as 'normal' also happens to live with mental illness. Still, my past experience makes me reluctant to do that at this stage.

I'm immensely grateful to people who do speak out publicly about their experience of mental illness, their approach is bolder than mine.","Yes","","Yes","","","","",20601,"Brunswick - Coburg","Major cities - medium SES"

And if you find that you don't 'click' with that particular psychologist, you have to use yet another one of your 'allocated' sessions to try someone else. Choosing a psychologist is a highly personal process and the limit on the number of sessions you can have means that many people (myself included) settle for a practitioner who isn't quite right for them because they don't want to go through the rapport building process all over again or are worried about using up their visit 'limit'.

I just had to soldier on, something that is very dangerous for anyone going through a mental health crisis. 
Also, the number of visits available to an individual is often not enough to deal with a single episode, let alone work on long term issues. Vulnerable clients often take a long time to build a relationship with a counsellor. Trust issues are usually a real problem for people who have been traumatised. 
Mental health continues to be stigmatised, despite the fact that the mind is a part of the body that can be injured just as easily as a leg or an organ. 
Sadly, some therapists are abusive rather than helpful. No one is advised of how or where to make a complaint about therapists of this nature.","","Living in a rural community, my options are limited. For the time I had to wait to see a psychologist, I did not feel there was anywhere else to turn. 
Having seen the lack of support suffered by a close family member as well as a friend, people with severe or persistent mental health problems have to throw themselves on the mercy of the local hospital which has a very small, often understaffed mental health ward, with fly in/fly out psychiatrists. Mostly, these desperate clients are sent away to a bigger facility which means they cannot have family support if they need it, or they are advised to go to half way houses to learn to live independently.
I knew it was pointless to go to hospital. I would have been deemed not 'sick' enough, sent away to Goulburn or advised to go to the half way house, also in Goulburn. I don't need to learn to live independently, I already do that quite successfully, nor do I wish to share space with recovering addicts and sicker people than myself. 
So I just had to wait. I pretty much just went to bed for six weeks. There are not enough facilities in rural areas. There are not enough therapists.

It worries me greatly.","I know, from my own experience and watching a family member suffer that the government has created a silent pandemic of suffering people with their crackdown on pain killers. Coming off these medications too quickly without any other options is causing untold anxiety and depression and for many, a worsening of their pain symptoms. This can and sadly may lead to suicide for some of these people.
Although the government can trot out 'studies' to prove how terrible the opioid crisis is and how concerned they are about opioid overdoses, this is not the lived experience of many people.
Rarely does a GP suggest that a person being rushed off opioids would benefit from counselling, instead patients are being bullied, threatened and intimidated by GPs who are running scared themselves by the governments sudden changes to the use of these medications. Having no control, no choices is adding to the trauma of already traumatised people who did not choose the pain conditions they live with, nor did they write their own prescriptions decades ago when opioids were found to be, and for many, remain, the best medications for pain.
This is just one issue where access to mental health providers is lacking. Add to that the ongoing trauma of the bushfires in my area and now the covid 19 pandemic and we have a recipe for increases in the numbers of people suffering with mental health issues, with limited places to turn.
I do not know the answer but I do know the government is out of touch with the problems experienced by anyone with mental health issues.

I accessed mental health support after becoming unexpectedly pregnant (with my husband, in my 30s). I had, like many women been sexually assaulted when younger and being pregnant brought up some challenges/flashbacks.
When upping our life insurance/income protection insurances later - as we'd worked through my challenges, become parents etc - I found out that ANY history of accessing mental health support, even preventatively like I had, meant that I would not be covered for ANY mental health conditions in my policies.
This felt overly punitive by the insurance company, and has genuinely made me pause before accessing support during the lockdowns as I have been financially disadvantaged by accessing support - because of rape/abuse. I would need to not access help for this for 5 years to be able to have this waived.
I would be curious to know how many life insurance companies refuse to cover women for accessing mental health support as a result of rape?","","I have, like many others, struggled with lockdown.

My story is more a concern with failures in the ADF medical system, and inadequacy of DVA coverage for mental health issues - see below.","","I'm a former ADF member. After discharging from ADF for mental health reasons, I eventually sought help from my GP, which has turned my life around. During the last years of my ADF service however, it became clear that despite a well publicised focus on dealing with mental health issues, The ADF really has no clue what to do when handling a ""live"" case. When I owned up to my superiors that I was struggling, they were briefly caring before moving on to how my illness would affect unit objectives. I was hand-balled to the base Mental Health Nurse, who told me that my questionaire responses indicated depression and anxiety, but in his opinion I was only suffering stress. At a point where I was unable to make any sort of rational decision, he left it to me to decide on my treatment. A few ineffectual sessions with a counsellor failed to make any difference and in desperation I discharged from the ADF. My condition continued to spiral out of control until my family took control and made an appointment with a GP, who after reviewing my questionaire responses immediately prescribed at anti-depressant and referred me to a psychiatrist for review and a psychologist for counselling. I only wish the ADF health system could have acted so decisively.","I hold a DVA White Card for mental health treatment, however, when I needed treatment urgently, I found that the recommended Psychiatrist and Psychologist would not take DVA patients. DVA were unable to supply contacts of service providers who would treat me as a DVA patient. I was in no fit state to be shopping around, and fortunately able to afford the gap under Medicare. In conversation, my Psychologist told me that DVA payment rates have not increased in more than 15 years, and, in fact, are significantly lower than the rate paid by the ADF for treatment of serving members, leading to situations where discharging ADF members are unable have continuity of treatment if they wish to utilise their DVA Card. This makes a complete mockery of DVA and politicians (Scott Morrison included) claiming to make a priority of the welfare and mental health of ADF Veterans.","Yes","","","","","","","","",""

My GP advised me to try and find someone that was a good fit from the beginning so I didn't have to shop around and eat into my sessions, but I would have really liked to be referred to someone in the same way I can be referred to an allergy specialist, or a specific breast clinic for screening. I was already at breaking point when I went to the GP and felt I needed help right away, so having to research was really hard emotionally. That also meant a week delay between my initial consultation to when I got the referral letter from my GP because I had to give her the name to put on the letter.

It was incredibly hard to be fit the visits in around work. I had to find someone near to work so I could go during my lunch breaks, which limited my access because I had to factor travel time into the appointment when I was researching options for who I could see. And then it was almost impossible to make the times fit with the psychologist - I set up a series of pre-booked appointments so I could pre-arrange my work, but then they were all cancelled due to changes to her schedule, when she took holiday leave, or due to double-bookings.

It was really hard to book through her reception - I had to work out in advance all the potential days and times I was free and then go through them all one-by-one with the receptionist to work out when worked for the psychologist. 

In the end I gave up trying to book again. I only had two sessions over a 4 month period. It would have been great if there'd been an online calendar I could have accessed.","","I honestly thought I was going to hurt myself eventually. There were a few days the anxiety was too much and I called in sick. My partner was afraid to leave me alone and once even took a sick day as well because he was worried about what I'd do to myself. My partner carried the burden of making sure I kept on going, which put a strain on our relationship. 

COVID-19 was kind of a blessing for me because I was offered a chance to take a redundancy at work and it's given me the chance to try and rebuild myself with a little pocket money. Things are better now but I still have anxiety and panic attacks and some nights I can't sleep for stress. I'm worried there are problems under the surface that will re-emerge because they haven't actually been treated, but I also don't feel I can go back to the psychologist as I'm monitoring my money now and it was expensive even with the subsidy.

Have you tried to access mental health services through your GP? We want to hear about your experience.

Doctors use the Better Access program to help you access up to 10 subsidised individual and up to 10 subsidised group sessions a year with a mental health professional.

It usually starts with a visit to your GP for a mental health care plan but you can also get a referral from a psychiatrist.

If you've never used the Better Access program before, we'd love to hear what's stopped you (perhaps you'd never even heard of it).

Or maybe you've used it in the past but haven't renewed your plan or didn't use all of your sessions.

We're keen to hear what got in the way, whether that's the cost, location, finding a time in working hours, finding childcare, or something else altogether.
If you or anyone you know needs help:

    Beyond Blue on 1300 22 46 36

Doctors don't have the knowledge to refer people to psychologists that will meet the patients needs so its generally just luck that determines whether the client and psychologist are compatible.
This matching process is even harder if you are male. With many issues, men are generally more comfortable talking to other men (relationships, grief and anger etc). The trouble is that the profession is overwhelmingly made up of women.
I have had 4 groups of sessions with different psychologists. Twice with female psychologists in couples therapy which were a disaster partly for the reasons detailed above and partly because my wife is a psychologist and (I felt that) she was manipulating the therapist.
The times I have gone alone to a male psychologist that I had specifically sought out, I did not continue because I thought they were old and had the cultural sensitivities of an earlier generation.
Anecdotally I have heard similar stories from other men and don't consider my situation unique.","","I am in a situation where my marriage has failed but we stay together for the sake of the children. I cant repair the relationship nor can I overcome the ongoing grief and depression. I just carry on, hiding my feelings, just like my wife probably does.
At work, I cant deal with any kind of conflict because I have no sense of self worth so I have had to give up on any professional ambitions.

1. Do I need a Psychologist or Psychiatrist? I was supposed to choose but how would I do that?

2. I have learnt you need to ""click"" with a therapist. I did not realize changing therapists is not a crime - I felt as if it were.

3. Where do I find a therapist? Some GP's are reluctant to make a personal recommendation

4. What is the aim? I know a broken leg is healed when it stops hurting so much. It is different with mental health issues. I feel you cannot ""go back"" but where is the goal of going ""forward""?

Being able to see a good psychologist has, in the past, meant the difference between being bed- and house-bound with major depression and anxiety for months vs being able to be a healthier and more productive member of society.

The main factor that has made it difficult for me to access the service is the out of pocket cost - about $60 per session.

I am 55 and have had little paid work since I was retrenched from full time work at a university five and a half years ago. I do not receive Centrelink payments. 

I am surviving by living a very lean lifestyle and redrawing from the mortgage. (When I had full time paid employment, I worked hard to pay the mortgage down as quickly as I could, so was ahead in payments when I was retrenched). 

Last August, I was mainly confined to bed for two months with major depression. Coupled with sometimes severe anxiety, I was often unable to leave the house to obtain food. 

The out of pocket expenses of seeing a psychologist through the plan - which would likely have helped me to recover much quicker - and an increasingly dire financial situation meant that I didn’t obtain help from the psychologist.

I was fortunate to eventually connect with a community health care centre that assisted me, for no charge.

In the past month, i have become unwell again and have again sought help through the community centre. 

I don’t wish to go to the bowels of hell again and have decided that seeing the psychologist may well be a financial investment I may need to make, in the hopes that it will restore my health to a state where I can obtain at least some paid work.

I have searched online for bulk billing psychologists, without success.

If they were more available, it would be an enormous help to people who have limited financial means.","","I became very ill. I was basically a body that was breathing but doing little else.

I felt unable to deal with people, so restricted contact. 

I was unable to answer or make phone calls. The most I could cope with was checking the phone every few days for text messages. I did this solely to avoid worrying people and to let them know I was still alive.

One person who noticed my long absence from social media left a message - which I felt unable to check and therefore respond to - drove some distance to my house to check on me. A number of people she knows have ended their lives and she feared I was another one to do so.

Asleep with earplugs in, to ensure I could be unconscious and pain-free for as long as possible, I didn’t hear her knock.

She called the police. They got into my house to confirm I was still alive. I was mortally embarrassed, but they were very kind and understanding.

It would have been much better to have felt able to seek the help I needed than to become this unwell,  to worry people and consume police resources.","Despite the out of pocket costs, the Better Access plan is saving lives and I am grateful for it.

Thank you for what you’re doing to highlight the importance of maintaining mental health.

I couldn't see my GP as he was high risk and not taking appointments, so I went to another doctor at the same practice.

The appointment cost $200 for the 20 minute visit. When I received the plan I contacted the psychologist she had referred me to and discovered the subsidized price for each appointment was $150 a session. In this time of economic uncertainty and stress I do not have $1500 spare. (Indeed, stress over my finances and job uncertainty was a major cause of my anxiety, as I explained to the GP.) 

I said I couldn't afford it, and was told to find a psychiatrist who I could afford and let the doctor know who it would be so they could re-issue the plan, but it was unlikely I would find anyone. I don't know any mental health professionals, and didn't have the capacity to investigate (even writing this has brought me to tears again), so I gave up.","I'm still barely hanging in there. The GP also prescribed medication, which was only $69 for a month's worth. I wanted to try therapy rather than anti-depressants, but the GP said I was too far for it to assist much without the medication. I could afford the drugs, so I am taking them. They are helping a bit, but I am afraid of the long term consequences of not addressing the cause of my problems/feelings. My prescription ends next week and I am not sure what to do.

Some days are better than others, but the medication is, for now, helping keep me from the darkest places (suicidal thoughts have reduced dramatically, but they are still there) and have enabled me to get some work done again (although I still have days where I can't achieve anything, and am so afraid of the long term consequences of this).

The process of having to go back to the GP to extend the plan  after six sessions for the last four of ten sessions is ludicrous - another hurdle for patients to have to pay for and jump through -using up their already diminished emotional/energy and financial reserves. The psychologist should be able to trigger the extension if they believe it is in the patient's best interests without the need to go back to the gp. and they should be able to extend beyond the ten sessions too if they deem appropriate/required. - psychologist should be required to advise the gp if this happens.
More shared care collaborative team mindset between psychologist and gp required -especially where medication is involved.
Plans need to allow family members to attend the psychologist without the patient if patient resists treatment or psychologist needs to change family / caregiver behaviours to assist patient. This is important in OCD and anxiety to assist family/caregivers through the process of withdrawing accomodating behaviours that can exacerbate/entrench patient OCD/anxiety.","GP refused to write a plan for our child because the GP said he(the GP) objected to the scheme because believed the scheme just lined the pockets of psychologists. (I think he meant because in his opinion it encouraged psychologists to charge more because they knew patients were getting medicare relief. - and possibly to run more sessions to use up the 10 sessions claimable per year.)

We had to go to a different gp to get a plan. Our experience is that some complex conditions (OCD GAD School Refusal) cannot be resolve in 10 sessions and this adds a layer of stress and potential failure of the treatment when stopped prematurely due to financial considerations. 

There is also the issue of needing to try different psychologists to find one that fits - ie actually has relevant condition-specific treatment success and gels with the patient - that dynamic is vital to treatment success. Just because they treat a condition doesn't mean they use the best technique or do it well ie treat but not successfully. - this is particularly true of OCD using CBT with ERP. This can be traumatising and damaging when not done properly and is likely to do more harm than good setting the patient back and entrenching beliefs that the condition is permanent and a part of the person's identity.","Inability to attend school - ie education basically lost from start of year 5 to year 12 now,

Also it is wrong to lump OCD and anxiety only sufferers into programs or facilities that also cater for other mental health and drug and alcohol conditions as the environments are triggering/unsafe for OCD Anxiety patients and the expertise of staff is too generic and therefore often damaging.
We do not lump all physical ailments into ""Physical health"" and use the same facilities, approach  and staff to treat. We have dedicated centres and departments etc eg cancer centres - and even specialist cancer-type specific programs - eg breast cancer. But we do not do this for mental health.

In fact when I did eventually go to the GP she warned me that psychologist appointments can still cost hundreds of dollars even with the Healthcare plan funding.

The other issues is finding the right professional for you.  They always say that you need to find the right person who you believe you can work with and provides value and help.

Also my workplace was quite intense, and I was unable to commit to appointment times during weekdays.  I was continually cancelling or postponing my appointments.

During my initial subsidised sessions I was somewhat embarassed to ask for the time off work, as my coworkers would inevitably ask what was wrong, was I sick, etc. I was embarassed, and didnt want to mention my condition, yet at the same time felt that I had to so that they wouldnt assume that I was taking weekly sick leave for something physically severe like cancer treatment or something.

Another barrier was the cost, despite being subsidised, each session was costing me around $100 from memory (it was nearly 10 years ago now)
As part of my anxiety/stress was related to my financial and work situation, taking extra time off, and spending $100 per week did somewhat add to my concerns.","Originally, before my first appointment, a large barrier was actually accepting that I needed help.
For years prior i had silently dealt with anxiety, depression, and the related health problems to those conditions.

The main barriers to me initially seeking help were:

- feeling that, as a male, seeking help was seen as weak.
- Not knowing that a GP was able to help with mental health
- Assuming that psychologists were only for people with extreme mental health concerns.

Probably the biggest barrier, initially, was that as I lived in a rural area, there was very little privacy.
Every person in town always seemed to insist on knowing everybody's business, this led to a fear that if I ever mentioned that I was having difficulty coping, that the entire town would know about it and ostracize me.","Thankfully I was able to access help, and while my sessions were limited to the 10 subsidised ones, it did help me immensely, both in giving me some ways to cope, but mostly, to normalise my issues to the point where I no longer fear people finding out that I have mental health concerns.

If I had not been able to access help at the time, I most likely would have continued to push away those who love me, and would have most likely have gone through with one of my thoughts of self harm.","While my mental health concerns do remain, and I still have both good and bad days, thanks to the help I received, and from learning how to be open about what I went/go though, I am able to cope far better than I have in my life.

Being able to be open and speak with people about these thoughts/feelings has been an immense help, both for myself, and for others.

One of my proudest moments has been when my father was having difficulty coping after his only remaining brother passed away.
We sat down and spoke freely with each other, I finally revealed to him that I myself suffered from mental health issues, and that I had in the past considered ending my life.
While it was a difficult conversation for both of us, it genuinely helped us all.
I understood my father better than ever, and most importantly, dad knew that the feelings he had weren't strange, weren't a sign of weakness, and that help was available if he wanted it.
Both from professionals (which he did seek eventually), and from myself.

Just being able to freely speak about his own mental health helped him so much, and being able to freely speak to him about my own issues meant that he didn't feel alone in the battle.




Also, thank you ABC for running these stories, they help us all so much.
If you have any questions at all, about my personal experience, about specific symptoms I have/do experience, or anything at all, please feel free to ask me.

Also, please don't feel concerned if you have any queries that you may feel are too personal, or that you may think could trigger bad memories for me etc. A large part of the difficulty in understanding mental health is that people are concerned to ask certain questions, which just leads to an odd taboo around them.
I understand that many people may not be comfortable answering some questions like that, but I am letting you know that I am comfortable with it.
So feel free to ask.

Unfortunately, the practitioner was not trained in the therapies I needed and the treatment was not particularly helpful. I need to see a dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) informed practitioner for borderline personality disorder (BPD) and post traumatic stress disorder. Other treatments are minimally effective, and this is backed by the science. Fortunately I had access to DBT via the community mental health services in 2012/2013 but I have not had any beneficial treatment since then. Importantly, men are not eligible for this service due to outdated government funding data based on gender bias in diagnosis of BPD. Men with BPD have no public options and the private options are delivered by private hospitals at a cost of around $9,000 for 12 weeks (as opposed to the 12 month best clinical practice). Besides the lack of specialisation and regulation of claimed specialisation, the amount of sessions allocated under Better Access is woefully inadequate for anyone experiencing mental health issues that aren't mild to moderate. It's fine for treating a bit of depression or anxiety, but it leaves people with severe and/or acute needs to their misery.

Unfortunately sometimes I go without treatment or a care plan because I cannot afford the treatment or face the pain of trying to get another care plan.

It’s worth it but it will have an impact on my financial position and life long term. I live with my parents still and being able to pay for treatment and potentially one day own a little home for myself and to have stability in the interim are all big parts of this. 
There doesn’t seem to be anything available for someone who doesn’t need hospital admission. It’s a mess. Most GPs should not be providing mental health care. I know that RACGP and ACRRM think they have enough training but as a patient- no, they don’t. Most GPs in my experience just want you to take antidepressants and go away. No follow up, no medication review or discussion of side effect risks. Just take the pills. 
I wish I could just get diagnosis as chronic or long term and not have to keep begging year after year.

As I have Borderline Personality Disorder, Bipolar Affective Disorder, complex PTSD and Depression the frequency of sessions needs to be far more than 10 sessions. In my experience using the Mental Health Plan more than once is useless because by the time the Psychologist has properly assessed you there are usually only 3 to 4 sessions left which are usually a month apart.  I equate it to watching your favourite soaps where there is a cliff hanger but the channel says you have to wait another month to know what's going on. Accessing 10 sessions is too painful  because you cannot even go past the surface in 10 sessions.

My psychiatrist didn't bother to even asses me for bipolar disorder nor did he believe me when I told him I was suicidal. Other doctors waved away my concerns about bipolar disorder for up to 7 years, when I finally stopped asking them about it.
That same psychiatrist denied I had seizures from taking Ritalin, and he upped my dose every couple of weeks giving me some of the most life wrecking side effects. When I told a GP about my Ritalin side effects he brushed them off, so I learned to not tell doctors my seizures, hypoglycemia, severe weight loss, hallucinations, all round feeling of dying was not from Ritalin. As you may have guessed a lost my trust in doctors after that. Then I reluctantly saw a gender psychologist who I opened up to so I could take hormones.

And they only subsidized about $50 of the cost. So they were good, though I never opened up about any non gender identity related anxiety and depression, but I just couldn't afford to keep seeing them. When I did want to see them to finally open up they were booked out for months.

But. I found little or no empathy with the psychologist I ended up with. He gave me some practical advice which certainly helped me at the time deal with my anxiety symptoms, but there was no attempt to identify and treat the underlying causes. Maybe a bit much to expect in just four sessions, but still. 

I had no desire to extend my care with him.","","The result of this was I kept functioning like a good little worker, but did not *get better*. In fact my anxiety and depression got worse. I was just better at coping. This affected my marriage, my career, my relationships with my friends and my family, and my general health. I became a shell of a man.","Two years later, I tried again. I did some searching online and found a psych that, fortunately, I do respond to much better. I feel I have made some actual progress with the treatment of my mental health conditions. I am in a better place, even though I am better aware now of the effort in front of me.

And that's the sad truth of it: psychological care is *very* personal - as a patient you need to make yourself very vulnerable to a veritable stranger, to be deeply honest, and to accept sometimes painful truths in return. As a psychologist? You're obviously a good and caring person in the first place, but it must be so exhausting to care for all these people. You can't just phone it in. 

I suspect treatment in which there is poor rapport between client and psych could be as bad as no treatment at all. 

And I am also aware that my ability to shop around for a better psych reflects my privilege - this would not be possible for people with less money, time, or access to services. Having been through this, I am now aware that mental health services are as important as physical/medical health services, and I strongly support efforts in this space to destigmatise mental health care, and to extend the capacity of the system.","Yes","Yes","Yes","","","","",80106,"South Canberra","Major cities - higher SES"

I have tried many times over the years without success. As a teenager, I had chronic fatigue syndrome which most doctors believed was a mental rather than physical illness. I had to see a psychiatrist who told me I was making everything up for attention. He also gave me anti-depressants which made me suicidal. I never told anyone though. I just stopped taking them. I think that experience caused a lot of the problems I have now.

As an adult, I have spoken to my GP several times about mental health. I think his advice is somewhat clouded by the fact that he treats my older sister who has lifelong mental health issues and by comparison I probably seem okay. He has referred me to at least two psychiatrists but both have been very expensive (at least $200 per hour). At the end of one of the sessions, the psychiatrist said she didn't know what the problem was. This was extremely disheartening because it had taken a lot for me to speak to the GP and then attend the appointment. Most recently, he told me to just do more things to stay active. I have never been offered subsidised sessions despite being on a health care card and not having full-time employment.

She then seemed to realise what she had done and gave me another number for a triage service. I phoned them and he asked if I was suicidal.

While sessions were subsidised, I still needed to pay for the sessions up front before applying for the rebate from Medicare, and this was difficult to manage without going without other things in an already frugal life. There was also a gap between the fee and the rebate. I had already established a relationship with a psychologist through recommendation, and felt that there was understanding and progress taking place. I didn't wish to see someone who needed to be brought up to speed with my story with a background and rapport that had already been established, as well as a plan that reflected my own capabilities and led me to further learning. This continuity of care was very important to me as well as presenting better 'value'.

In the end, after my financial situation became more stable, despite being offered a new supported mental health care plan, I was able to visit my psychologist through my workplace's employee assistance program and self-funded as a regular touch-in. I felt somewhat disempowered and my issues trivialised at some point in talking to a GP, and found the standard mental health 'test' extremely triggering in the sense that I didn't feel I had enough problems to warrant the assistance.","","I'm lucky that there was no fallout.

I saw a psychologist through my GP because, at the time, I had been long term unemployed due to my medical condition (Multiple Sclerosis). I was volunteering for a few organisations but the fact that I wasn't making money was getting to me. I started seeing a psych who ended up asking more questions about my condition than about how I was going in the grand scheme of life. For example, I would begin talking about an experience to do with, say, travelling on public transport and I would get asked why I didn't have a license. I told them that I don't drive any more because of my MS symptoms. I then had to go into what those symptoms were and how they were caused because (by admission) they didn't know much about MS. After conversing about how MS affects me my appointment time would be over without me talking about anything I actually wanted or needed to. It could be thought that the psych was wanting to know about my MS but I wasn't getting asked how my condition affected me in any other way than 'so what do you mean when you say you're right leg doesn't work properly?' This example about driving was just one of many.","","I stopped going to my appointments because I got a job and couldn't afford the time. I have since lost that job but the fallout for me is that I don't want to return to see one of those GP psychologists because I don't want to educate them about MS.

I had terrible experiences with psychologists and psychiatrists before, and I was vaguely stable. I didn't want to risk destabilising myself with a bad psych, and then only have a couple of visits left to find a new psych and restabilise.

2. Amount of sessions.
As someone with a complex (not really, just consistently poorly treated) condition, I need to be able to access sessions if a crisis happens. This means I'll ""save up"" sessions. Instead of addressing issues when I'm healthy and able to process things, I save my sessions in case a crisis happens, or something traumatic happens. Without support from my psychologist I end up in the emergency department.
Related to this is the time limit of 6 in 12 weeks, then a further 4 if necessary. When you get a MHTP in a semi-crisis setting, you use it. You may be on the road to recovery, you've seen a professional once a week for 4 weeks, and you're definitely safe to taper down to a visit every 10 - 14 days. Unfortunately you only have 2 visits left to cover you for the next 8 weeks, and you stare at your options: pay out of pocket? stop going?. Both lead to a breakdown, an escalation of care, and often undoes progress.
I've also stopped treatment because a plan wasn't working. If you have a treatment plan laid out over 9 sessions, but you aren't able to process all you should've in the early sessions, you see that this treatment will stretch out to 12, 15, 17 sessions. So you stop the treatment very early to avoid being left without access to a rebate in a very precarious mental position.

3. Cost
This is almost the most important, and ties into the amount of sessions. The rebate is $84.80. Apart from headspace and state run initiatives, I have never been bulk-billed. A psych who ensures their space is accessible to themselves, to their patients, who has work-life balance and who continues to do training and research will have a gap fee, and at times I have stopped going because the expense made my mental health worse than treatment could fix it.

4. Doctors not filling out forms correctly. 
Literally just the result of your doctor running 35 mins late, trying to make up time by rushing a mental health appointment and messing up the paperwork as a result.","","Instead of addressing issues when I'm healthy and able to process things, I save my sessions in case a crisis happens, or something traumatic happens. Without support from my psychologist I end up in the emergency department.

I may end up paying out-of-pocket or stop going entirely, but both lead to a breakdown, an escalation of care, and often undoes progress.

When doctors don't fill out a form correctly you spend weeks chasing people up and making and breaking appointments and it hurts your mental health so so so much.","I'm happy for this to be published, but I'd like to see how it's been edited beforehand. My words have been twisted before and I'd prefer that not to happen again.


This happened over the Victorian and West Australian mental healthcare systems. Unsurprisingly, my appointments nowadays often have to address the ways the Victorian system treated me and what issues it has created.

Also, the 10 sessions is a good idea but it could be carried out better and more appropriately. As someone with a psychiatric disability, 10 visits isn't close to what I would ideally have to manage this condition. In addition, members of my family have attempted to access visits, but without being ""anxious enough"" or ""depressed enough"" they were unable to get visits, and would come along to mine in order to process their own interactions with my illness. This wasn't ideal for anyone, however it's what had to be done in order for them to be able to be around me.

The entire mental healthcare system needs to be restructured to provide better ongoing support, and increasing the rebate. In addition, more support needs to be given to regional and remote programs, and this needs to be appropriate for those communities.

I am a guy and, at the time, was in my late 50's and feeling burnt out from work as a construction project manager. I wanted to discuss coping strategies and talk through other stress management methods that a psychologist might offer. Alternatively, I was considering early retirement or a late-career change, neither of which I thought were desirable.
The first psychologist I saw was a woman in her mid 30's. And it was only at the end of my 2nd session that I decided we weren't on the same wavelength. The first session was pretty broad ranging: you tell your life story in 30 minutes, you are asked about any known emotional trauma, your primary support network and early emotional influences, etc. The second session is more focussed, but in my case I felt the session didn't seem to be setting up an ongoing strategy for the remaining sessions. In fact I felt that she hadn't really understood how critical the problem was for me and that I was there for more than just a chat and a bit of a download.
I asked the GP for another referral and this time saw an even younger male psychologist who seemed unsure of himself. I didn't feel like wasting more sessions so I asked for a 3rd referral. By now I had wasted over a month. 
This time I saw a woman in her late 50's who immediately gave me confidence that she could understand my problem and suggest some options. By our 2nd session she was proposing strategies, setting me homework, and suggesting a few books I could read. She was experienced enough to ask me some penetrating questions and made sure I didn't avoid answering them. She was empathetic and I trusted her advice. 
My advice to others is, if you've only got 10 sessions, don't waste time with a psychologist who seems too willing to let you to download endlessly about every minor emotional event in your life before eventually getting to the bigger issue that brought you to his/her rooms. If you don't feel by the end of the 2nd session they have identified some key issues and will then be proactive in guiding you to set up a self-help methodology, they probably aren't right for you. 
In the end, you have to solve your own problems, make your own decisions. A good psychologist, in my opinion, is one that guides you, nudges you in the right direction, pulls you back from blundering catastrophe. Make sure your GP refers you to a fully accredited CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST. There are many psychologists out there (who your GP is allowed to refer you to) who don't have the extensive clinical training that comes with the advanced qualification. 
Be prepared to put some effort into solving your own problems. No psychologist can solve them for you.

After surviving a previous suicide attempt a month prior, I thought at the time that by ODing it would either kill me, something I had accepted, or actually get help by being taken into hospital. 

In the hospital, I told the nurse and doctor multiple times why I did what I did e.g. end my life, finally get some help but was told that because they didn't have a mental health counselor on staff that day (Sunday) there was nothing they could do to help. 

The thing is, I actually in tears as I told them I wanted to die and If I left I don't know what was going to happen to me - this didn't seem to elicit any empathy. I could not believe that a hospital in the middle of the CBD didn't have the resources to help a suicidal person that had just self-harmed.

Lucky for me I was able to make it to my GP who is in my view one of the best practitioners I have ever come across, and since he has treated me since I was a child, has seen me grow up and worked very closely with me to get access to a private, higher-cost service - but one that ultimately put me on the road to recovery.

I never had to sign a care plan if that helps?

As for why I would or wouldn't access treatment? Not stigma for a start. But my reluctance to go in at first was fear of being locked up mostly, plus fear of treatments like electroconvulsive therapy, even though I knew it couldn't be forced on me when I had no history of harm to myself or others, the fear of it was still there regardless (I'm in WA, it's still practised here). Plus the risk of having my voting rights taken away, or just I guess spending the rest of my life being stripped of my autonomy, treated forever like a child. 

I did eventually go in when I needed a doctor's certificate. Again, with the fear of being hospitalised involuntarily even though I knew my rights as a mental health patient, I knew they couldn't when I was no threat to self or others, but I was still afraid of it anyway. I remember sitting in the waiting room terrified I was never going to be let back out, reading all the pamphlets telling me what they could do to me, involuntary hospitalisation, loss of voting rights etc, or the ECT one telling me that yes I had the right to choose but here was the one option I could choose from. That one was patronising. But at the end of the session, I got let out. And the next session, and the next, and eventually I felt a bit more comfortable that they weren't going to lock me up.

They eventually discharged me back to my GP and I've quite happily left the mental health system. They were never of any help really, just added stress, and I'm glad to be out of there.

Each time it was through a GP's referral and after each referral expired, she shopped GPs and started again. 
At her request, sometimes I accompanied her to an appointment, because she wanted my opinion/ feedback on whether or not I thought the relevant practitioner was ""good for her"". Afterwards, we would then discuss what transpired during that appointment. Each time my response to her was positive and encouraging, but said that ultimately, the decision was hers.
At the expiration of these referrals, on our visits to the GP, the report from the (then) psychiatrist and psychologist came to the same conclusion. Obviously, she didn't agree and would challenge the GP.
These processes took their cumulative toll on our marriage, and eventually we were divorced. But the saga didn't stop there.
During the divorce proceedings, I was shocked when her lawyer produced a letter addressed to all and sundry, i.e. ""To Whom It May Concern"", in which one of her psychologists (yes, psychologist), whom I had only seen once, AS AN OBSERVER, proceeded to character-assassinate me, and claim ""each time"" (again, once), I displayed some ""psychology mumbo-jumbo"" behaviours.

In hindsight, it would have been better to have been referred to a Social Worker.  Social Workers tend to have broader skills and are better able to work with clients where they are at.

She also NEVER asked for feedback regarding how I was finding the sessions and if my needs were being met, so there was little opportunity to communicate my needs, although I tried - this is generally a symptom of the health professional viewing themselves as very much the 'expert' which is very off-putting for most people.

While some of us locked down our practices the result is people being funnelled into over-priced services and many will be by default prescribed psychotropic drugs.","Over the years colleagues have attacked anyone who criticizes the sector. The ABC has on several occasions covered my stories. I at one time had authority similar to a royal commissioner and am currently an adjunct lecturer in a medical research facility.

There were authoritative warnings before the virus that the mental health sector had the potential to 'wreck the economy' and the virus has accelerated these trends. I have plenty of research material to offer on this. 

Among the dangers of my offering a mental health treatment plan to a patient is that as soon as I have accepted a single dollar of Medicare money to treat you, you have in turn accepted a lifelong label that will pass to your children as 'family history of mental illness'. This is no prediction. As an expert witness I have seen this nonsense in official reports tendered by unscrupulous colleagues to quash insurance claims. 

The other big issue is quackery. Mental health treatments rarely beat placebo. MBS recently approved a long-debunked quack treatment. Barely-trained 'paraprofessionals' get the same results as $350/hr so-called services by highly-trained professionals. The psychotherapies with a 'number needed to treat' of 3-4 (3 people treated for one to show a statistically-signif diff) only look good compared to the drugs which can range as high as NNT=8 or more. ECT is still being offered. And all of the 'false positives' suffer a psychiatric label.

I am not a patient. I am a provider and advocate. Instead of the usual talking head interviews these issues need source reference to the countless journal articles that have reviewed this sector.

The latest installment was Duke University's review of mental health symptoms in NZ, concluding that 86% of their population effectively had a history of mental illness! 

The Productivity Commission expressed dismay that their 2019 draft had been interpreted as 'mental illness checks' and drugs for kids. I had to point out in testimony that their draft had referred to drugs and used the term 'mental illness' 220 times, so was no media beat-up.

I also have a chronic health issue that contributes heavily to my feelings of depression. I have admitted myself to the ER in the past for suicidal intent.

Access has always been an issue but it’s not the only issue. I have never found a psychologist covered by the mental health care plan that is also suited to me. I believe it’s because they are in a clinical setting and seeing so many people with a variety of worries a day. So doing your own research and finding a psychologist that works for you - in my case, I specifically needed a psychologist for my chronic illness issues - usually means that the psychologist you end up seeing costs upwards of $150 a session. While this is do-able perhaps once a month, it isn’t affordable in all cases. A sympathetic psych will alter their rates, but when you are in a crisis and feel you need to see somebody once a week, that $150 or even $100 cost isn’t feasible anymore. 

I also refused to continue sessions with a therapist in the past as she clearly had no interest in me. Our 50-minute sessions only went for 20-25 minutes (she never remembered who I was or what was going on in my life) and she once texted me the booking confirmation for another client.

I once had a psychiatrist tell me I had the right to kill myself because I was over 18 and then repeated this to my parents in the vicinity of her 5 or 6 year old daughter who had been picked up by school by the receptionist (Oh, by the way, that psychiatrist's website said she lectured at the Uni I was at)... This was after I was told I could not have antidepressants again because of antidepressant induced hypomania by a hospital and I was referred onto her by the hospital...

Because of this; 5 years later after this incident; I started waking up really early and feeling more social and not myself (like hypomania)... However, because of this traumatic incident I did not feel like I could go to psychologist by myself... So I raised this to the psychologist and she was dismissive in one sentence... and my mother was there and agreed with her...didn't feel like pressing the issue because of my mother... Kept waking up really early but I didn't do anything about it differently (didn't wake parents up) because my mother had said you always react badly to medication...

My psychologist then told me re sleep to get out of bed if I couldn't get to sleep. When I raised them a subsequent session she told me that she didn't say that re waking up early

Also my mother got distressed about me and insisted in going in a session with me... I clammed up about worrying about being bipolar...

Also this psychologist had told me to contact previous old number before 1300 MH CALL.. So I was feeling really distressed so I attempted the old number but it didn't work... So I went to Emergency Department of the hospital close to Uni... They told me they were too busy and gave me the new number... So I gave up on talking or ringing that number because I remember how the hospital referred me to the psychiatrist who told me I had the right to kill myself.

I was also told by the psychologist to contact the counselling services at the University previously (despite the website saying if you have a long term condition see someone privately)... So I made an appointment... There was a Masters Student... I don't think she knew that a hypomanic episode can make people act weird, irritable and not themselves and can cause you to lose friends... Earlier that semester, it was an anniversary of a dead friend's birthday (the grief triggered depression_; so I googled the people who were in the friendship group with the friend.. (lost them because I was doing Distance Education due to a medical condition for high school and depression and not bumping into people). Anyway, I google one of the friends and I find out she's gone back to Uni to start a music degree and is giving a concert 2 days after my dead's friends birthday... So I go to the concert (but I wasn't planning to make personal contact) only I make the mistake of sitting outside the concert room for more than 30 minutes beforehand.. Anyway, it when I made the appointment with the Masters Student... she was like when I mentioned I had lost the friend due to depression etc... it was like if you see her again it would be okay... Also tells me she thinks I'm not hypomanic

Then I get suicidal because I'm having difficulty concentrating because of waking early; having flashbacks etc... 

Anyway, I finally muster up the courage to book an appointment to see a psychiatrist and I wait 2 months.

So I randomly climb the roof of a building at Uni, thinking of getting rid of myself... only it was meant to be sealed off but it had a brick jamming the door open. So I had rang 1300 MH CALL the weekend before and I get a nurse practitioner to assess me - saw her letter to the GP and her first sentence was about me wearing loose clothing and no makeup...

So I had gone to the psychologist after this incident and it was the end of the calendar year... She tells me in reception to not make any appointments until I have seen the doctor (I assume she means the psychiatrist because of my suicidal thoughts and how she had told me if distressed to contact 1300 MH CALL or Uni)

See the psychiatrist, and then get told in the session that he's too busy and I'm too complex for only 20 minutes for an 1hour or more initial appointment... doesn't charge any money though He then says he does medico legal stuff..

Anyway, we go back to the GP... And the letter from 1300 MH CALL (which was a month ago) tells me to see a neuropsychologist... Anyway, I go there and neuropsychologist says she is going to do an expensive 4 hour assessment. My parents and I ask whether if there are any deficits whether there will be exercises to help them... So I get this report and I get told that I have low percentiles in attention and working memory... and then I get told by the neuropsychologist that she mainly does assessments (despite saying there were things one could do). So my mother did refer this onto a family friend but for the family friend after the assessment the neuropsychologist did do additional sessions with the family friend... Anyway, I got the impression that neuropsychologist assessment subsequently is more designed for people with brain lesions etc (after going to a neuropsychologist seminar out at Uni about people trying to working out the areas of lesions in the brain from various tests without an MRI and then the research was also about teaching techniques to fix those deficiencies and which ones were more effective)

Anyway, I had booked another appointment with Uni (however, the counseller was also a yoga instructor so she told me to do legs at the wall for my sleeping issue). I also gave her the psychologist email address... Supposedly the psychologist had told her that she meant I was to have more sessions but because the psychologist didn't email me back (she had email with materials previously and reluctance to empathise with my symptoms I didn't make any more sessions. Also because we were told about the neuropsychologist and that the psychologist had told me to ring 1300 MH CALL; I guess I felt like that she wasn't comfortable with treating people who felt like they might have bipolar or suicidal thoughts) (Did a PhD on people with addictions.)

So I wait another 2 months for a psychiatrist and he was like I'm working on the hypothesis you have bipolar II disorder... any way the medication didn't make me feel any better and the doctor attempted to get the receptionist to charge for time I didn't have (against Medicare). Raised it with doctor and he was like ""You get most of it back, don't you","","I experienced unresolved grief of dead friend and lost friends, concentration issues, flashbacks of when I had antidepressant induced hypomania; waking up really early, crying, weird email writing on several occasions when trying to get out of Uni research experience... but I couldn't say I'm unwell because I had gotten a 7 in a course... I cannot talk to my mother about it because she get's very distressed about stuff and the fact she doesn't think that medications work for me or trusts psychiatrists... So I get myself sick (with flashbacks and grief), rack up Uni debt because I had to wait 4 months to finally see a psychiatrist after making a decision after several months because of dismissing of psychologists.. You have a weak argument for getting HECS debt removed if you have a pre-existing condition so I didn't even try.. Also there was 10 year credit rule I was worried about; so I was hoping medication would fix my sleep and the concentration and magically kick in.","I've had other bad experiences... I had a psychiatrist after only 1 antidepressant; suggest ECT for the next treatment... His justification was ""It does no harm and I'm in charge of it at this hospital"" (It was a private hospital) I was really depressed but not actively suicidal... like I couldn't get out of bed or didn't shower for a month...","Yes","","","","","","","","",""

I've been seeing a therapist once a week of once a fortnight for the last two years. The first one didn't have a provider number or attract the Medicar benefit, though he did charge on a sliding scale. The second therapist I saw was a councillor, not a psychologist, so no Medicare. She also was only offering Zoom teletherapy for a while at the peak of the pandemic, which I found much less helpful than face-to-face sessions, and charged the usual rate. The third did have medicare, but a long wait list. I saw her twice, but decided she wasn't the a good fit for me. I am soon to see a new therapist, who is a psychologist, sho comes highly recommended, but it is a 6 week wait to get an appointment, and she doesn't offer a medicare reimbursement in any case.

Another restriction: I am queer and trans and obviously need a therapist who is gender-savvy. I understand there are still ignorant, cissexist, and transphobic mental health proffessionals out there. I have not personally encountered a discriminatory therapist, because I have thouroughly vetted the ones I go to. In Sydney, this usually means travelling ~1 hour into the city or inner west, and being prepared to forgo Medicare beneftis if the trans-friendly, lesbian-friendly therapist happens not to attract a Medicare benefit.","","I've been lucky so far that I can afford to pay for therapy sessions out of pocket without the Medicare benefit, and so haven't actually missed out. But I am dipping into savings and living with family to make it work, so I haven't really felt the fallout yet. It would be a great help if adequate mental health services were subsidized by Medicare. I do not know how I would have got by the last two years, let alone the last few months, with only 10 sessions allowed per year, or having to compromise and see someone I wouldn't get along with.","I don't know why exactly I haven't been able to use my mental health care plan from my GP. I'm not sure what is preventing more psychologists from registering with Medicare, but I have been wondering why more aren't. Therapy has been a huge help for me over a very difficult period. 10 sessions of therapy per year isn't close to adequate and my GP always stresses how important therapy is and how bombing me with drugs isn't a solution.

At my worst, I really needed to see a psych of counselling every week or every two weeks and that's impossible under the current system.

Whilst some psychology and counselling sessions have been useful for me, I have received the most benefit from diagnosis, recognition and pastoral counselling and support. For me, psychotherapy has been an interesting pursuit, but an largely impotent tool in really helping my mental health.

Originally I was first referred after suffering from my first panic attack at 22. I then spent 2.5 years getting counselling for OCD and Anxiety from a Psychologist, who never investigated my mood or checked for depression. When I moved state in 2015 I had my first proper bout of major depression and was referred for counselling and recieved medication. I tried two psychs who I felt didnt take me seriously before I found one who was 'fine'. Learning and understanding more about depression it became clear to me and my pyschologist that although now 25 had been depressed since 15/16 - something that I, my parents and school psychologists had dismissed as merely teenage hormonal angst.

For some of us, depression and anxiety is how we are wired and they will never go into full remission. They are awful and some psychotherapy can give us some tools to understand them better and at the very least not be our own worst enemies. For some lile myself, who are hyperfunctional despite the strength of our mood disorders, we develop mental tools and cognitive behaviours to manage myself that echoe the psycotherapy techniques deployed in counselling. For people like me, I remain unsure to this day, as I continue to seek treatment in the form of psychotherapy and medication, as to when I am going to find a psychologist that actually has some tools that will help me - there is no way for me to know and its hard to investigate and find out information on psychologists and there specialisations and how they work and who they work with.  

From what I read in the science, we still know next to nothing about depression and anxiety. Psycotherapy works for some, but it is ultimately just attempting to treat the symptoms of the disease.

The sessions were strictly timed to about 50-55 min each. 
About 60% of fees (from memory) was govt funded. The rest need to be paid at each visit.

The approach of getting defining the problem in first 2-3 sessions by answering guided questions while wise notes are taken. So my answers lead to a guided, obvious clinical definition and treatments based on self-realisation, acceptance (that the problem is mine) and that I fix it  (ie its all in me, not outside of me and not a responsibility of others).  I don't need a psychologist for any of that. I can do such self analysis largely myself or rely on close friends for advice and opinion.

In 1975 I had a break down. I was treated by a gp for high blood pressure, then with anti depressants. In the early eighties I was referred to a psychiatrist. I was prescribed many different meds but in all cases they did not address the core issue, anxiety. I persevered for 30 years with this psychiatrist.

So many victims of depression often find it difficult to seek help because they don't think they need help.

Since the first session, I have learnt to accept the fact that I have depression and it's ok to seek help.
