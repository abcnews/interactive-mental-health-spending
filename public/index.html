In fact, we spent 33 times more per person on <strong>Darebin-South</strong> than <strong>Katherine</strong>.</p><a name="markKEYalliedselfSWAPtruePANELalliedself"> </a><p>In <strong>Darebin-South, </strong>we spent <strong>$4912</strong> on <strong>46.49</strong> sessions of care per 100 people in 2017-18.

I just had to soldier on, which is very dangerous in a mental health crisis.</p><p>"It was pointless to go to the local hospital. I would've been deemed 'not sick enough' or sent away to Goulburn, where [people in my situation] can't have family support if they need it. So I just had to wait. I pretty much just went to bed for six weeks.</p><p>"The crackdown on opioid painkillers is just one issue in rural areas where mental health care is lacking. Add to that the ongoing trauma of the bushfires in my area and now the Covid-19 pandemic."</p><a name="markKEYaverageline"> </a><p>But it's not just country folk losing out. Even in cities, for every dollar we spend on those in highly advantaged areas, we spend 76 cents on people in low-advantage areas.<br/> </p><p>Mike* lives in one of those less advantaged city areas — Wollongong.</p><a name="markKEYmiketestimonialCUSTOMtruePANELmikeinitial"> </a><p>"My quality of life goes up significantly when I can have a session every fortnight, then it goes right down again when I can't. When I'm doing well I can work a bit and take care of myself. When I'm not well I can't leave the house, can't sleep, can't care for myself or my child. It's cost me years of my life, struggling, being poor, unable to access proper health care and feeling like a useless burden on society.</p><p>"It'd cost about $5000 a year for me to see my psychologist fortnightly. Contrast this against the $20,000 or so I get for the disability pension every year. If they helped me get on my feet and supported me to stay there I'd cost the taxpayers way less, and I'd be a contributing member of society."</p><a name="markKEYpsychiatrists"> </a><h3>The most unequal care of all</h3><p>Nowhere is the inequality more pronounced than when it comes to <strong>psychiatrists in private practice</strong>.</p><p>For every dollar taxpayers spend on psychiatry for remote Australians, we shell out $3.45 for people in disadvantaged city areas and $7.70 for people in our most advantaged suburbs.</p><a name="markKEYlauratestimonialCUSTOMtruePANELlaurainitial"> </a><p>ABC reader Laura* lives in a medium-advantage area and says even with a "well-paying job", the upfront cost to see a psychiatrist is prohibitive.</p><p>"I was referred to ensure that my antidepressants were the right ones for me but the appointments were $400. </p><p>"I nearly had another breakdown, I couldn't get the help I needed. I was trying to improve my mental health, I didn't want to be in the dark place anymore. I wanted to continue in life."</p><a name="markKEYclinicalpsychologists"> </a><p>Psychiatrists and clinical psychologists are the most specialised and highly trained professionals in the mental health care system, but this data suggests they're accessible for a select few only.</p><p>For every person who sees a <strong>clinical psychologist </strong>in a remote area, <a href="https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/primary-health-care/medicare-subsidised-gp-allied-health-and-specialis/contents/introduction" target="_self" title="">six people will be accessing care</a> in a highly-advantaged city area.<br/> </p><a name="markKEYgpmentalhealth"> </a><p>We can see that people from all backgrounds are seeking help by looking at who's visiting <strong>GPs for mental health reasons</strong>.</p><p>But for less advantaged or more remote Australians, the journey often seems to end in their GP's office.</p><a name="mark"> </a><p>"While wealthier Australians are often getting access to quality care that combines psychology and medication, poorer Australians are often left with only medication from their GP, which can put them on the back foot with recovery," says Professor Graham Meadows from Monash University's Department of Psychiatry.</p><a name="endscrollyteller"> </a><a name="whatsgoingongraphic"> </a><h2>So what's going on?</h2><p>The number of Australians getting psychological care has exploded since Medicare rebates were introduced in 2006. Some <a href="https://www.pc.gov.au/inquiries/completed/mental-health/draft/mental-health-draft-overview.pdf">1.32 million Australians</a> have a mental health care plan from their GP — a piece of paper that <a href="https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/mental-ba-fact-pat">opens up subsidised sessions with psychologists and other professionals</a>. </p><p>Others are seeing psychiatrists in private practice and <a href="https://www.yourhealthinmind.org/psychiatry-explained/cost-to-see-a-psychiatrist" target="_self" title="">getting a portion back</a> from Medicare.</p><p>Many ABC readers told us this support has been "life-changing". As Caitlan from eastern Sydney put it, "I feel so lucky to have accessed this service which allowed me to build a stable life. I can travel, I have friends, I have familial relationships — I owe all that to receiving the help I did."</p><aside class="embed-wysiwyg richtext">

You only get a portion back from Medicare and the rebate can take a couple of days.</p><p>Many Australians simply can't cough up those fees and bulk-billing psychologists are rare and usually have long waiting lists.</p><p>To access psychological care, you need to get a <a href="https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/mental-ba-fact-pat">mental health care plan,</a> which involves a double appointment with a GP at the start and a review after the sixth psychology session. If you don't have a <a href="https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/australian-health-services" target="_self" title="">bulk-billing GP</a>, that's the cost of three to four doctor's appointments on top of the psychology fees.</p><p>The number of one-on-one psychology sessions you can receive a rebate on has <a href="https://www.health.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/2020/10/additional-10-mbs-mental-health-sessions-during-covid-19-faqs-for-consumers-additional-10-mbs-mental-health-sessions-during-covid-19-faqs-for-consumers.pdf" target="_self" title="">just been increased from a maximum of 10 per year to 20,</a> in response to the pandemic. (People with eating disorders have a special exemption and can access up to 40 sessions). Beyond this, you're paying full fees. Before these extra sessions were introduced, many readers told us the 10-session cap was limiting their recovery.</p><a name="gallery"> </a><blockquote><p>There's just not enough sessions to truly get into my trauma. I have borderline personality disorder and complex post-traumatic stress disorder. I can't fix this in 10 visits. When Covid happened I had to take stress leave and was almost hospitalised. I was suicidal. The system isn't set up for people with complex mental health needs. Some people have told me to apply for the NDIS but I'm too exhausted to battle another government system. It's very hard to be mentally unwell in Australia.</p><blockquote class="quote--pullquote"><p class="p--pullquote-byline">Ashleigh, Chermside, QLD</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><p>I contacted the psychologist and the subsidised fee was $150. In this time of economic uncertainty I don't have $1,500 spare. I was told it was unlikely I would find anyone I could afford. I didn't have the capacity to investigate (even writing this has brought me to tears), so I gave up.</p><p>I wanted to try therapy, but I could only afford medication. I'm afraid of the long-term consequences of not addressing the cause of my feelings. I think about reaching out for help again, but feel bitten. I am barely hanging in there.</p><blockquote class="quote--pullquote"><p class="p--pullquote-byline">Anonymous, North Canberra, ACT</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><p>The clinical psychologist is $300 per session. But when you've struggled through several psychologists, and finally found someone who helps, you need them even if they're expensive. Already traumatised people can't keep spilling their story to strangers repeatedly.</p><blockquote class="quote--pullquote"><p class="p--pullquote-byline">Anonymous, Pennant Hills–Epping, NSW</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><p>I never asked for being sexually abused for over a decade as a child, to now be told that if I want a normal life I have to pay tens of thousands to even have a shot. I can't get into or maintain any friendships, relationships. Some days I can't get out of bed to work. I think if Australia had a robust public mental health system, the burden on social services would not be so heavy.</p><blockquote class="quote--pullquote"><p class="p--pullquote-byline">Anonymous, Penrith, NSW</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><p>If a person can be so mentally unwell that they end up harming themselves, why do we charge them to get better? When an emergency happens in a hospital we don't always have to have the finances to pay for necessary surgeries so why is it different with mental wellbeing?</p><blockquote class="quote--pullquote"><p class="p--pullquote-byline">Rebecca, Adelaide Hills, SA</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><p>During the process of seeking a mental health plan, I requested a bulk-billing psychologist as a single father of three. When I attended my appointment it turned out this was not a bulk-billing service. Three sessions in, I had over-extended my budget and never returned. I already had severe anxiety associated with feelings of inferiority — being unable to financially support my mental health exacerbated this and I spiralled into further depression and suicidal ideations.</p><blockquote class="quote--pullquote"><p class="p--pullquote-byline">Matt, Townsville, QLD</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><p>Costs were extremely prohibitive. With rent and bills, I couldn't even afford to complete all the discounted sessions, let alone continue beyond that. It was the start of a downwards spiral that ended with me being temporarily homeless, long-term unemployed and charged with domestic violence.</p><p>We're meant to have public healthcare — that system should include mental health, otherwise people will continue to suffer unnecessarily.</p><blockquote class="quote--pullquote"><p class="p--pullquote-byline">Anonymous, Loganlea-Carbrook, QLD</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><p>Even though the subsidy helps a lot, there are still out-of-pocket costs and these can be hard to manage, especially when three of us in our family of four are seeing a psychologist. My children suffer from anxiety and my son also has ADHD. Life is very challenging for him, so his psychologist has been so very much needed. So, I would prioritise my children and forgo my very much needed sessions. When Covid-19 hit, my mental health declined rapidly. I knew I had to re-engage with my psychologist which honestly is what has saved me.</p><blockquote class="quote--pullquote"><p class="p--pullquote-byline">Anonymous, Chermside, QLD</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><p>I have regularly used all my sessions by May and this year by March. I've been using these subsidised visits since their inception when it was 18 sessions a year. They were then reduced to 12 and then 10 sessions. I have only last year managed to pay off a $40,000 credit card debt incurred for mental health treatment over the years. I am highly educated with a PhD and Masters but I've been on Jobseeker since 2009 because I find it hard to get the treatments I need.</p><blockquote class="quote--pullquote"><p class="p--pullquote-byline">Tracey, Geelong, Vic</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><p>I found it stressful to save the money for the following sessions, so the vicious cycle continued, but on another level — financial. I had not sought help for financial stress, but it was now added to my anxiety and depression due to an abusive relationship I had escaped.</p><p>I waited three months to get an appointment. By then for many, it could be too late. It took a lot for me to ask for help, and when I finally got the courage to pick up the phone, only to be told of a significant delay, it was very disheartening.</p><blockquote class="quote--pullquote"><p class="p--pullquote-byline">Anonymous</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><p>I couldn't afford the sessions at the start of the year, and the stress and anxiety of the bushfires and hailstorm and other personal matters built up to an unbearable level. I understand these programs are expensive for governments, but it's been a really tough year for so many.</p><blockquote class="quote--pullquote"><p class="p--pullquote-byline">Anonymous, South Canberra, ACT</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><p>Last year I had an acute experience of mental illness. I was on a waiting list for a psychologist for about 11 weeks.</p><p>I would gladly pay for mental health care if I could. But if I worked more, my Centrelink study allowance would be cut off, and I'd have to do a hell of a lot more hours to make up for it.

The <a href="https://www.pc.gov.au/inquiries/completed/mental-health/report/mental-health-volume1.pdf" target="_self" title="">Productivity Commission has recommended telehealth as a "priority reform"</a>, but the Government has previously resisted calls to offer it outside of the pandemic.</p><p>But does mental health care have to involve an hour on the couch? Dr Sebastian Rosenberg from the University of Sydney <a href="https://theconversation.com/online-therapies-can-improve-mental-health-and-there-are-no-barriers-to-accessing-them-111357">has argued</a> that free <a href="https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/etherapy" target="_self" title="">online therapy courses</a> with a variety of durations that are available at any time are accessible for more Australians. <a href="https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/etherapy" target="_self" title="">Online programs</a> can also be made culturally sensitive, getting around the fact that psychologists are overwhelmingly white.</p><p>However, many psychologists feel <a href="https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/etherapy" target="_self" title="">online programs</a> are inadequate, saying the most important thing for healing is the personal relationship between therapist and client.</p><p>Still, it's clear the one-size-fits-all approach is failing to serve Australians from all backgrounds.</p><p>"There's growing discussions overseas about how psychologists are largely from affluent backgrounds, university-educated and from inner-city areas" says Professor Meadows.</p><p>"You can see how someone from a different background might not feel a connection with that kind of person. So we need to recognise that different groups need different approaches."</p><a name="affordablecaregraphic"> </a><h3>Affordable care exists, but there's a catch</h3><p>We've looked at the providers where care is most unequal, but what about those that are doing better?</p><p>Let's return to our dots for a second.</p><a name="scrollystagemount3"> </a><a name="scrollytellerNAMEthreeKEYotherallied"> </a><p>The only services that aren't heavily skewed towards more advantaged city folk are provided by <strong>"other" allied mental health workers</strong> — a group that includes mental health nurses, Aboriginal health workers and some accredited social workers and occupational therapists.</p><p>We spend so little on this group of health providers that we need to zoom in to see the trends.</p><a name="markKEYotheralliedzoom"> </a><p>Finally, we see a flattening of the curve, with the exception of the most remote Australians.</p><p>The reason these providers are more accessible is because rather than operating in private practice, they're usually employed by organisations whose mandate is to reach disadvantaged or isolated areas.</p><p>But unfortunately, <em>very few</em> people are receiving these services.</p><a name="markSWAPtruePANELotherallied"> </a><p>For example, we're spending the most per person in WA's <strong>Wheat Belt - South</strong> region, yet this is helping just <strong>1.14 per cent</strong> of people.</p><a name="markKEYgpfocus"> </a><p>Some <strong>GPs</strong> also have special training to offer <strong>family or individual therapy</strong>, but this is used even less. While this could be a way of offering accessible therapy for low-income families, just <a href="https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/primary-health-care/medicare-subsidised-gp-allied-health-and-specialis/contents/introduction" target="_self" title="">15,655 people</a> accessed this care in 2017-18.</p><a name="endscrollyteller"> </a><p>So, while more equitable care exists, it's not being widely deployed.</p><p>Compounding the problem, Medicare offers no rebate to see counsellors or other therapists, who typically have much lower fees than psychologists.</p><p>This is designed to prioritise forms of care with the strongest evidence base. But the exclusion means a large chunk of Australia's mental health workforce is effectively underutilised, while patients are locked into care they often can't afford beyond 10 sessions.</p><p>Making matters worse, organisations who traditionally employed psychologists (like hospitals, companies and universities) realised over the years that they could save money by sending people to the Medicare system instead, where consumers must foot the gap fee, according to the Australian Psychological Society. The peak body says this practice of "cost shifting" has seen the number of psychologists employed by organisations shrink.</p><a name="distancegraphic"> </a><h2>How do we burst the city bubble?</h2><p>So what would it take to make access to psychologists look less like this?</p><a name="averagechartmount"> </a><p>To reverse the city skew, we could start by improving the incentives for psychologists and psychiatrists to practice in regional areas.</p><p>We could also work to remove the barriers to telehealth for country Australians, like variable internet and having to visit a GP in person for a referral.
