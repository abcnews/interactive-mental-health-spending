      <div class="story richtext">
        <p>If there’s one thing we can all agree on, it’s that 2020 has been a rough year.</p>
        <p>It started with the country in flames before shifting from one apocalyptic scenario to the next as
          coronavirus reached our shores.</p>
        <p>With Australia staring down a “mental health pandemic”, it’s worth asking, is our system equipped to cope?
        </p>
        <p>Besides landing in an emergency department, most Australians access mental health care through the Medicare
          system.</p>
        <p>You might be one of the approximately <a
            href="https://www.pc.gov.au/inquiries/completed/mental-health/draft/mental-health-draft-overview.pdf">1.32
            million Australians</a> who’ve been given a mental health plan by your GP - a piece of paper that <a
            href="https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/mental-ba-fact-pat">opens up
            Medicare-rebated sessions with psychologists and other professionals</a>. Or you may have seen a
          psychiatrist in private practice.</p>
        <p>Taxpayers are spending <a
            href="https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/mental-health-services/mental-health-services-in-australia/report-contents/expenditure-on-mental-health-related-services">$1.3
            billion each year</a> on Medicare rebates for mental health care, so it’s time we asked - is help getting to
          those who need it most?</p>
        <p>We’re about to show you some fancy charts, but to make them more relevant for you we’ll need your postcode,
          or a postcode you’re curious about. Don’t worry, we’re not storing or re-using this information.</p>
        <h2>Is your area accessing care?</h2><a name="postcodesearch"> </a>
        <p>This year, we’ve all become experts in reading curvy lines. But we’re about to show you a curve you might not
          have seen before.</p><a name="scrollystagemount"> </a><a name="scrollytellerNAMEoneKEYdistressed"> </a>
        <p>This line tracks the proportion of people experiencing a high level of psychological distress.</p><a
          name="markKEYleastmost"> </a>
        <p>On the left we have the most disadvantaged fifth of Australians and on the right we have the least
          disadvantaged.</p><a name="markKEYyourquintileSWAPtruePANELyourquintile"> </a>
        <p>[write some fallback text here that will show up on AMP and Apple News and if a user has JavaScript disabled]
        </p><a name="markKEYyourquintile"> </a>
        <p>As you can see, distress rises with disadvantage. It makes sense that if you’re struggling to put food on the
          table and make rent, you’re likely to be distressed.</p><a name="markKEYmentalcondition"> </a>
        <p>And it’s not just distress - disadvantaged Australians have higher rates of mental and behavioural conditions
          also.</p><a name="mark"> </a>
        <p>So you might expect the bulk of our tax dollars to be subsidising care for these Australians. The sicker you
          are, the more likely you are to be seeing someone about it, right?</p><a name="mark"> </a>
        <p>Wrong. Let's show you just <em>how</em> wrong.</p><a name="endscrollyteller"> </a>
        <h2>(Subhead TBC)</h2>
        <p>We've crunched the numbers to see who’s getting access to Medicare-rebated care, which is how most
          Australians access mental health services outside of landing in an emergency room.</p><a
          name="scrollystagemount2"> </a><a name="scrollytellerNAMEtwoKEYallied"> </a>
        <p>This chart shows where we’re spending the most on allied mental health services through Medicare (that’s care
          provided by psychologists and other mental health professionals, excluding psychiatrists).</p><a
          name="markKEYalliedgroups"> </a>
        <p>Each of those dots is an area of Australia, grouped into six major categories.</p><a
          name="markKEYalliedselfSWAPtruePANELalliedself"> </a>
        <p>In your area of &lt;&lt;SYDNEY INNER CITY&gt;&gt;, taxpayers funded &lt;&lt;25.6 sessions&gt;&gt; of care per
          100 people, which cost &lt;&lt;$2,790&gt;&gt;. That’s &lt;&lt;more&gt;&gt; than the national average of 22.87
          sessions for $2,375.</p><a name="markKEYalliedselfSWAPtruePANELalliedself2"> </a>
        <p>This allowed &lt;&lt;5.08%&gt;&gt; of people in your area to access subsidised mental health care, which is
          &lt;&lt;around&gt;&gt; the national average of 5.06%.</p><a name="markKEYhighadvantage"> </a>
        <p>As you can see, we’re spending the most on areas in major cities with a high level of advantage.</p><a
          name="markKEYlowadvantage"> </a>
        <p>Spending is lowest in remote areas, and everywhere else falls in the middle.</p><a
          name="markKEYlowhighadvantage"> </a>
        <p>In fact, taxpayers are funneling five times as much dosh to highly advantaged city slickers as they are to
          remote Australians, and people in the regions are missing out too.</p><a name="markKEYkayetestimonial"> </a>
        <p>Kaye lives on NSW’s South Coast. She's just a few hours from inner-city Sydney, but in her neck of the woods,
          the proportion of people who get funding to see a psychologist is half what it is in the big smoke.</p><a
          name="mark"> </a>
        <p><strong>"I just had to soldier on"</strong></p>
        <p>It took over 6 weeks after a particular crisis before I was able to see a psychologist. I just had to soldier
          on, which is very dangerous in a mental health crisis.</p>
        <p>Living in a rural community, my options are limited. I knew it was pointless to go to hospital. I would have
          been deemed not 'sick' enough or sent away to Goulburn. People with severe or persistent mental health
          problems have to throw themselves on the mercy of the local hospital which has a very small, often
          understaffed mental health ward, with fly in/fly out psychiatrists. Mostly, these desperate clients are sent
          away to a bigger facility which means they cannot have family support if they need it.</p>
        <p>So I just had to wait. I pretty much just went to bed for six weeks.</p>
        <p>The crackdown on opioid painkillers is just one issue in rural areas where mental health care is lacking. Add
          to that the ongoing trauma of the bushfires in my area and now the Covid-19 pandemic - it worries me greatly.
        </p><a name="mark"> </a>
        <p>But it’s not just country folk losing out. For every dollar we spend on wealthier city-siders, we spend just
          77 cents on people in less advantaged city areas.<br /> </p>
        <p>Mike* lives in one of those areas - Wollongong.</p><a name="mark"> </a>
        <p><strong>"It's cost years of my life"</strong></p>
        <p>I’m on a disability pension because I have bipolar 2 disorder. My quality of life goes up significantly when
          I can have a session every fortnight, then it goes right down again when I can’t. When I’m doing well I can
          work a bit and take care of myself. When I’m not well I can’t leave the house, can’t sleep, can’t care for
          myself or my child. It’s cost me years of my life, struggling, being poor, unable to access proper health care
          and feeling like a useless burden on society.</p>
        <p>It’d cost about $5000 a year for me to see my psychologist fortnightly. Contrast this against the $20,000 or
          so I get for the disability pension every year. If they helped me get on my feet and supported me to stay
          there I’d cost the taxpayers way less, and I’d be a contributing member of society.</p><a
          name="markKEYpsychiatrists"> </a>
        <p>THE WORST OFFENDERS</p>
        <p>As we can see, it’s an unequal system, and if we look beyond allied health to psychiatrists, things get even
          worse.</p>
        <p>For every dollar taxpayers spend on psychiatry for remote Australians, we shell out $4.80 for people in
          disadvantaged city areas and $7.70 for people in our wealthiest suburbs.</p><a
          name="markKEYclinicalpsychologists"> </a>
        <p>It’s a similar story when we check out clinical psychologists.</p>
        <p>For every person who sees a clinical psychologist in a remote area, six people will be accessing care in a
          highly-advantaged city area.<br /> </p>
        <p>Psychiatrists and clinical psychologists are the most specialised and highly trained professionals in the
          mental health care system but this data suggests they’re accessible for a select few only.</p><a
          name="markKEYgpmentalhealth"> </a>
        <p>We can tell that Australians from all backgrounds are seeking help by looking at who’s visiting GPs for
          mental health reasons. While there’s still fewer remote Australians seeking help, the curve is flatter than
          other providers.</p>
        <p>But for less advantaged Australians, the journey seems to end in their GP’s office.</p><a name="mark"> </a>
        <p>“While wealthier Australians are getting access to care, poorer Australians are left with only medication
          from their GP and the research shows medication alone is less effective in treating mental illness in the
          long-term, which puts them on the back foot in terms of recovery,” says Professor Graham Meadows from Monash
          University’s Department of Psychiatry.<br /> </p><a name="endscrollyteller"> </a>
        <h2>So what’s going on?</h2>
        <p>‘You don’t send someone with cancer home after ten appointments’</p>
        <p>More than 600 Australians shared their experiences of accessing mental health care through Medicare with us,
          and the number one barrier cited was the cost of appointments.</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.psychology.org.au/for-the-public/about-psychology/what-it-costs">recommended rate
            for a psychologist is $260 per session</a>, while an initial consult with a psychiatrist will set you back
          around $400. You can get a portion of the cost back from Medicare, but you need to have the full amount
          upfront and the rebate can take a couple of days.</p>
        <p>Many Australians simply can’t cough up those fees and bulk-billing psychologists are rare, with long waiting
          lists. And while you can have an unlimited number of rebated sessions with a psychiatrist, rebates on a
          psychologist are <a
            href="https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/mental-ba-fact-pat">capped at 10
            individual and 10 group sessions a year</a>.</p>
        <p>To access those 10 sessions, you typically need a <a
            href="https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/mental-ba-fact-pat">mental health care
            plan from a GP</a> which involves a long appointment (double the cost), plus a review after the sixth
          session. That’s the cost of three to four appointments before you even get to the psychologist’s fees.</p><a
          name="gallery"> </a>
        <blockquote>
          <p>There’s just not enough sessions to truly get into my trauma. I have borderline personality disorder and
            complex post traumatic stress disorder. I can’t fix this in 10 visits. When COViD happened I had to take
            stress leave and was almost hospitalised. I was suicidal. The system might be OK for people with depression
            and anxiety but it isn’t set up for people with complex mental health needs. Some people have told me to
            apply for the NDIS but I’m too exhausted to battle another government system. It’s very hard to be mentally
            unwell in Australia. There is almost no support.</p>

        <p>Both the Productivity Commission and the Government’s Medicare taskforce think Australians should be able to
          access more subsidised sessions. </p>
        <p>The taskforce has recommended that people have up to 40 subsidised sessions a year, depending on the severity
          of their condition. Healthy people “at risk” of mental illness should also be able to access rebates, the
          taskforce says, which are currently only available after you’ve developed a mental condition.</p>
        <p>Lifting the 10-session cap would allow psychologists to use forms of therapy that take longer but produce
          better results for some conditions, like complex trauma and borderline personality disorder, which can’t be
          treated with the kind of therapy you can deliver in 10 sessions.</p>
        <p>But increasing the number of rebated sessions wouldn’t help those Australians who can’t afford the gap fee to
          begin with. </p>
        <p>Psychologists say they have to charge a gap fee as the Medicare rebate doesn’t come close to covering their
          costs. The rebate hasn’t increased since 2012, yet the costs of running a practice increase every year — which
          is passed on to patients.</p>
        <p>“To make it a truly universal system, you’d need to lift the rebate to a reasonable level and then make gap
          fees illegal,” says Professor Meadows.</p>
        <p>“Or, instead of having this fee-for-service model of privatised care, you put the almost-billion dollars a
          year of funding into bulk-billing centres in every area.”</p>
        <p>“With the current model, telehealth could lower gap fees by removing some of the costs of running a physical
          practice - but there’s no guarantee those savings would be passed on to patients.”<br /> </p>
        <h3>TIME</h3>
        <p>But money isn’t the only barrier. As they say, time is money, and “lower-income Australians typically have
          greater demands on their time,” according to Jennifer Smith-Merry, director of the Centre for Disability
          Research and Policy at the University of Sydney.</p>
        <p>Like most Australians, psychologists work during business hours with limited after-hours sessions that can
          fill up quickly. </p>
        <p>They prefer to operate in wealthier, city areas where people are more able to cop a gap fee, meaning everyone
          else must hike across town, which can take longer than the appointment itself.</p>
        <p>[MORE TESTIMONIALS GO HERE]</p>
        <p>There’s a possible solution — telehealth — which the Productivity Commission recommended this month. Yet the
          Government has long-resisted calls to offer this outside of the pandemic.</p>
        <p>Does mental health care always have to involve an hour on the couch? Dr Sebastian Rosenberg from the
          University of Sydney <a
            href="https://theconversation.com/online-therapies-can-improve-mental-health-and-there-are-no-barriers-to-accessing-them-111357">has
            argued</a> free online therapy courses with a variety of durations that could be accessed at any time would
          be accessible for more Australians. Online programs could also be made culturally sensitive, getting around
          the fact that psychologists are overwhelmingly white. </p>
        <p>But many psychologists feel online programs are inadequate, saying the most important thing for healing is
          the personal relationship between therapist and client.</p>
        <p>Still, it’s clear that the one-size-fits-all approach is failing to serve Australians from all backgrounds.
        </p>
        <p>“There’s growing discussions overseas about how psychologists are largely from affluent backgrounds, atheist,
          university-educated and from inner-city areas” says Professor Meadows. </p>
        <p>“You can see how someone from a different background might not feel a connection with that kind of person. So
          we need to recognise that different groups need different approaches.”</p>
        <h3>DISTANCE</h3>
        <p>We’ve looked at the providers where care is most unequal, but what about those that are doing better?</p>
        <p>Let’s return to our dots for a second.</p><a name="scrollystagemount3"> </a><a
          name="scrollytellerNAMEthreeKEYotherallied"> </a>
        <p>The rebates given to this group of health providers is so small, we need to zoom in to make out the pile of
          dots</p><a name="markKEYotheralliedzoom"> </a>
        <p>The only services that aren’t heavily skewed towards more advantaged city folk are provided by “other” allied
          mental health workers — a group that includes mental health nurses, Aboriginal health workers and some
          accredited social workers and occupational therapists.</p><a name="mark"> </a>
        <p>Finally, we see a flattening of the curve - with the exception of the most remote Australians.</p><a
          name="mark"> </a>
        <p>The reason these providers are more accessible is because rather than operating in private practice, they’re
          usually employed by organisations whose mandate is to reach disadvantaged or isolated areas.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, very few people are receiving these services.</p><a name="markSWAPtruePANELotherallied"> </a>
        <p>In your area of &lt;&lt;SYDNEY INNER CITY&gt;&gt;, just &lt;&lt;1%&gt;&gt; of people received this kind of
          care, compared with &lt;&lt;5%&gt;&gt; who saw a clinical psychologist.</p><a name="markKEYgpfocus"> </a>
        <p>Some GPs also have special training to offer family or individual therapy, but this is used even less. While
          this could be a way of offering accessible therapy for low-income families, just over 16,000 people access
          this care yearly.</p><a name="mark"> </a>
        <p>This is designed to prioritise forms of care with the strongest evidence base. But the exclusion means a
          large chunk of Australia’s mental health workforce is effectively underutilised, while patients are locked
          into care they can’t afford beyond 10 sessions.</p><a name="endscrollyteller"> </a>
        <p>Well to start with, we could introduce formal incentives for psychologists to work in country areas, like we
          have with doctors.</p>
        <p>In 2017, rural and remote Australians became able to access sessions through telehealth, but some barriers
          remain. Not everyone is comfortable doing therapy by videoconference (phone isn’t an option) and not
          everywhere has a stable internet connection. </p>
        <p>Plus, some readers told us they still had to drive hours to see a GP for their mental health care plan and
          review, which could be resolved by offering this through telehealth.</p>
        <p><em>I've lived in a remote community for the past couple of years. Earlier this year, I tried to access a
            mental health care plan through a telehealth service, but was told that a referral was not available except
            by visiting a GP in person first. The nearest GP is a 9 hour drive. It was very discouraging and made me
            feel even more isolated. I waited until I had some leave and a chance to visit town, accessing three
            sessions in two weeks with a psychologist before returning to work in the community, where I was able to
            continue sessions through telehealth. There seem to be even fewer avenues for mental health support for
            Aboriginal people living in remote areas.</em></p>
        <p>Alternatively, other medical professionals besides GPs could give referrals in country areas. “Any door
          should be the right door to get help,” says Dr Smith-Merry.</p>
        <p>“We treat australia as a monolith despite us all knowing that you can’t operate the same models in rural and
          regional Australia because those services just aren’t there. </p>
        <p>“Better Access was not really built with the different types of approaches you need in those areas. Yet
          people with disadvantage are more likely to live there.”</p>
        <p><strong>THERE’S NEVER BEEN A BETTER TIME FOR REFORM</strong></p>
