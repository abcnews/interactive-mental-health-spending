        <p>If there's one thing we can all agree on, it's that 2020 has been a rough year.</p><p>It started with the country in flames before shifting from one apocalyptic scenario to the next as coronavirus reached our shores.</p><p>With the pandemic taking a toll on our mental health, it's worth asking, can Australians get help when they need it?</p><p>Australians mostly access mental health care through the Medicare system. For example, you might be one of the approximately <a href="https://www.pc.gov.au/inquiries/completed/mental-health/draft/mental-health-draft-overview.pdf">1.32 million Australians</a> who've been given a mental health plan by your GP — a piece of paper that <a href="https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/mental-ba-fact-pat">opens up subsidised sessions with psychologists and other professionals</a>. Or you may have seen a psychiatrist in private practice and got a portion back from Medicare.</p><p>Taxpayers are spending <a href="https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/mental-health-services/mental-health-services-in-australia/report-contents/expenditure-on-mental-health-related-services">$1.3 billion each year</a> on Medicare rebates for mental health care, so it's time we asked — is help getting to those who need it most?</p><a name="accessingcaregraphic"> </a><h3>Is your area getting care?</h3><p>We're about to show you some fancy charts, but to make them more relevant for you we'll need your postcode, or a postcode you're curious about. Don't worry, we're not storing or re-using this information.</p><a name="postcodesearch"> </a><p>This year, we've all become experts in reading curvy lines. But we're about to show you a curve you might not have seen before.</p><a name="scrollystagemount"> </a><a name="scrollytellerNAMEoneKEYdistressed"> </a><p>This line tracks the proportion of people experiencing a high level of psychological distress. </p><p>The data comes from the National Health Survey, which predates the pandemic but shows how people are going in regular times.</p><a name="markKEYleastmost"> </a><p>On the left we have the most disadvantaged fifth of Australians and on the right we have the least disadvantaged. </p><a name="markKEYyourquintileSWAPtruePANELyourquintile"> </a><p>[In the most disadvantaged suburbs, <strong>XX% of people </strong>are highly distressed compared with<strong> XX% in the least disadvantaged.</strong>]</p><a name="markKEYyourquintile"> </a><p>As you can see, people in advantaged areas are less distressed, which makes sense.</p><a name="markKEYmentalcondition"> </a><p>They also have lower rates of mental and behavioural conditions.</p><a name="mark"> </a><p>So you might expect the bulk of our tax dollars to be subsidising care for people living on the other end of the spectrum.</p><a name="mark"> </a><p>Let's show you just how far off the mark that is.</p><a name="endscrollyteller"> </a><h2>Where your tax dollars are going</h2><a name="scrollystagemount2"> </a><a name="scrollytellerNAMEtwoKEYallied"> </a><p>This chart shows where taxpayers are spending the most on mental health appointments through Medicare, excluding psychiatrists. </p><p>The data is from 2017-18 as that's the most recent year available.</p><a name="markKEYalliedgroups"> </a><p>Each of those dots is an area of Australia, grouped into six major categories. That dotted line shows the trend using the average of each group. </p><a name="markKEYalliedselfSWAPtruePANELalliedself"> </a><p>In your area of &lt;&lt;SYDNEY INNER CITY&gt;&gt;, taxpayers funded &lt;&lt;25.6 sessions&gt;&gt; of care per 100 people, which cost &lt;&lt;$2,790&gt;&gt;. That's &lt;&lt;more&gt;&gt; than the national average of 22.87 sessions for $2,375.</p><a name="markKEYalliedselfSWAPtruePANELalliedself2"> </a><p>This allowed &lt;&lt;5.08%&gt;&gt; of people in your area to access subsidised care, which is &lt;&lt;around&gt;&gt; the national average of 5.06%.</p><a name="markKEYhighadvantage"> </a><p>As you can see, we're spending the most on advantaged city areas.</p><a name="markKEYlowadvantage"> </a><p>Spending is lowest in remote areas, and everywhere else falls in the middle.</p><a name="markKEYlowhighadvantage"> </a><p>In fact, taxpayers are funneling five times as much dosh to highly advantaged city slickers as they are to remote Australians, and people in the regions are missing out too.</p><a name="markKEYkayetestimonialCUSTOMtruePANELkayeinitial"> </a><p>Kaye's just a few hours from inner-city Sydney, but in her neck of the woods, you're half as likely to get funding for a psychologist.</p><a name="markKEYkayetestimonial"> </a><p><em>Living in a rural community, my options are limited. It took over six weeks after a particular crisis before I was able to see a psychologist. I just had to soldier on, which is very dangerous in a mental health crisis.</em></p><p><em>It was pointless to go to the local hospital which has a very small, often understaffed mental health ward, with fly in/fly out psychiatrists. Mostly, its desperate clients are sent away to a bigger facility which means they cannot have family support if they need it. So I just had to wait. I pretty much just went to bed for six weeks.</em></p><p><em>The crackdown on opioid painkillers is just one issue in rural areas where mental health care is lacking. Add to that the ongoing trauma of the bushfires in my area and now the Covid-19 pandemic — it worries me greatly.</em></p><a name="mark"> </a><p>But it's not just country folk losing out. Even in cities, for every dollar we spend on those in wealthier areas, we spend 77 cents on people in less advantaged areas.<br/> </p><p>Mike* lives in one of those less advantaged city areas — Wollongong.</p><a name="markKEYmiketestimonialCUSTOMtruePANELmikeinitial"> </a><p><em>My quality of life goes up significantly when I can have a session every fortnight, then it goes right down again when I can't. When I'm doing well I can work a bit and take care of myself. When I'm not well I can't leave the house, can't sleep, can't care for myself or my child. It's cost me years of my life, struggling, being poor, unable to access proper health care and feeling like a useless burden on society.</em></p><p><em>It'd cost about $5000 a year for me to see my psychologist fortnightly. Contrast this against the $20,000 or so I get for the disability pension every year. If they helped me get on my feet and supported me to stay there I'd cost the taxpayers way less, and I'd be a contributing member of society.</em></p><a name="markKEYpsychiatrists"> </a><h3>The most unequal care of all</h3><p>As we can see, it's an unequal system, and nowhere is this more pronounced than when it comes to <strong>psychiatrists in private practice</strong>.</p><p>For every dollar taxpayers spend on psychiatry for remote Australians, we shell out $4.80 for people in disadvantaged city areas and $7.70 for people in our wealthiest suburbs.</p><a name="mark"> </a><p><strong><em>COULD MAYBE LOSE THIS QUOTE: </em></strong><em>I was referred to a psychiatrist to ensure that my antidepressants were the right ones for me but the appointments were $400. This is why people aren't getting diagnosed properly.</em></p><p><em>People with mental health are already struggling. To put this financial stress on them is ridiculous! I nearly had another breakdown, one step forward, two back, I couldn't get the help I needed. I was trying to improve my mental health, I didn't want to be in the dark place anymore. I wanted to continue in life. - <strong>Miki</strong></em></p><a name="markKEYclinicalpsychologists"> </a><p>It's a similar story when we check out <strong>clinical psychologists</strong>.</p><p>For every person who sees a clinical psychologist in a remote area, six people will be accessing care in a highly-advantaged city area.<br/> </p><p>Psychiatrists and clinical psychologists are the most specialised and highly trained professionals in the mental health care system but this data suggests they're accessible for a select few only.</p><a name="markKEYgpmentalhealth"> </a><p>We can tell that Australians from all backgrounds are seeking help by looking at who's visiting <strong>GPs for mental health reasons</strong>. While there's still fewer remote Australians seeking help, the curve is flatter than other providers.</p><p>But for less advantaged Australians, the journey seems to end in their GP's office.</p><a name="mark"> </a><p>"While wealthier Australians are often getting access to quality care that combines psychology and medication, poorer Australians are often left with only medication from their GP," says Professor Graham Meadows from Monash University's Department of Psychiatry.<br/> </p><p>"Medication alone is less effective in treating mental illness and this can put them on the back foot in terms of recovery."</p><a name="endscrollyteller"> </a><h2>So what's going on?</h2><p>More than 600 Australians shared their experiences of accessing mental health care through Medicare with us, and the number one barrier cited was the cost of appointments.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.psychology.org.au/for-the-public/about-psychology/what-it-costs">recommended rate for a psychologist is $260 per session</a>, while an initial consult with a psychiatrist will set you back around $400. You can get a portion of the cost back from Medicare, but you need to have the full amount upfront and the rebate can take a couple of days.</p><p>Many Australians simply can't cough up those fees and bulk-billing psychologists are rare, with long waiting lists.</p><p>To access the Medicare rebate for a psychologist, you typically need a <a href="https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/mental-ba-fact-pat">mental health care plan from a GP</a> which involves a long appointment (double the cost), plus a review after the sixth session. That's the cost of three to four appointments before you even get to the psychologist's fees.</p><p>In response to the pandemic, the Government has temporarily increased the number of one-on-one psychology sessions you can receive a rebate on from 10 to 20 per year. Prior to this change, many readers told us the 10-session cap was limiting their recovery.</p><a name="gallery"> </a><blockquote><p>There's just not enough sessions to truly get into my trauma. I have borderline personality disorder and complex post traumatic stress disorder. I can't fix this in 10 visits. When Covid happened I had to take stress leave and was almost hospitalised. I was suicidal. The system isn't set up for people with complex mental health needs. Some people have told me to apply for the NDIS but I'm too exhausted to battle another government system. It's very hard to be mentally unwell in Australia. There is almost no support.</p><blockquote class="quote--pullquote"><p class="p--pullquote-byline"><strong>Ashleigh, Chermside, QLD</strong></p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><p>I contacted the psychologist and discovered the subsidised fee was $150. In this time of economic uncertainty I don't have $1500 spare. I was told it was unlikely I would find anyone I could afford. I didn't have the capacity to investigate (even writing this has brought me to tears), so I gave up.</p><p>I wanted to try therapy, but I could only afford medication. I'm afraid of the long-term consequences of not addressing the cause of my feelings.</p><p>I think about reaching out for help again, but feel bitten and as though it wasn't worth it. I am barely hanging in there.</p><blockquote class="quote--pullquote"><p class="p--pullquote-byline">Anonymous, North Canberra, ACT</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><p>The clinical psychologist is $300 per session. But when you've struggled through several psychologists, and finally found someone who helps, you need them even if they're expensive. Already traumatised people can't keep spilling their story to strangers repeatedly. </p><blockquote class="quote--pullquote"><p><strong>Anonymous, Pennant Hills–Epping, NSW</strong></p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><p>I never asked for being sexually abused for over a decade as a child, to now be told that if I want a normal life I have to pay tens of thousands to even have a shot. I can't get into or maintain any friendships, relationships. Some days I can't get out of bed to work.</p><p>Mental health is a largely private system. The most vulnerable often come from and live in poverty. I think if Australia had a robust public mental health system, the burden on social services would not be so heavy.</p><blockquote class="quote--pullquote"><p><strong>Anonymous, Penrith, NSW</strong></p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><p>If a person can be so mentally unwell that they end up harming themselves, why do we charge them to get better? When an emergency happens in a hospital we don't always have to have the finances to pay for necessary surgeries so why is it different with mental wellbeing? We need to find a better way where clients can get help but professionals also get paid.</p><blockquote class="quote--pullquote"><p class="p--pullquote-byline">Rebecca, Adelaide Hills, SA</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><p>During the process of seeking a mental health plan, I requested a bulk billing psychologist as a single father of three. When I attended my appointment it turned out this was not a bulk-billing service. Three sessions in I had over-extended my budget and never returned. I already had severe anxiety associated with feelings of inferiority — being unable to financially support my mental health exacerbated this and I spiralled into further depression and suicidal ideations.</p><blockquote class="quote--pullquote"><p class="p--pullquote-byline"><strong>Matt, Townsville, QLD</strong></p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><p>People on low incomes with moderate to severe problems just don't bother because they can't afford to take on long term therapy. They need to know they'll be supported for more than a few months to even start, because it's an exhausting process if you have to stop/start because you've run out of rebate sessions in 10 weeks.</p><blockquote class="quote--pullquote"><p class="p--pullquote-byline"><strong>Anonymous, Joondalup, WA</strong></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>-</p><blockquote><p>Costs were extremely prohibitive. With rent and bills, I couldn't even afford to complete all the discounted sessions, let alone continue beyond that. It was the start of a downwards spiral that ended with me being temporarily homeless, long-term unemployed and charged with domestic violence.</p><p>We're meant to have public healthcare — that system should include mental health, otherwise people will continue to suffer unnecessarily.</p><blockquote class="quote--pullquote"><p class="p--pullquote-byline"><strong>Anonymous, Loganlea-Carbrook, QLD</strong></p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><p>Even though the subsidy helps a lot, there are still out of pocket costs and these can be hard to manage, especially when three of us in our family of four are seeing a psychologist. My children suffer from anxiety and my son also has ADHD. Life is very challenging for him, so his psychologist has been so very much needed. So, I would prioritise my children and forgo my very much needed sessions. When Covid-19 hit my mental health declined rapidly. I knew I had to re-engage with my psychologist which honestly is what has saved me.</p><blockquote class="quote--pullquote"><p class="p--pullquote-byline"><strong>Anonymous, Chermside, QLD</strong></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>-</p><blockquote><p>I have regularly used all my sessions by May and this year by March. I've been using these subsidised visits since their inception when it was 18 sessions a year. They were then reduced to 12 and then the current 10 sessions. I have only last year managed to pay off a $40,000 credit card debt incurred for mental health treatment over the years.
