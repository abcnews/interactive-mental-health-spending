        <p>If there's one thing we can all agree on, it's that 2020 has been a rough year.</p><p>It started with the country in flames before shifting from one apocalyptic scenario to the next as coronavirus reached our shores.</p><p>As we grapple with a "mental health pandemic", it's worth asking, can Australians get help when they need it?</p><p>Australians mostly access mental health care through the Medicare system. For example, you might be one of the approximately <a href="https://www.pc.gov.au/inquiries/completed/mental-health/draft/mental-health-draft-overview.pdf">1.32 million Australians</a> who've been given a mental health plan by your GP — a piece of paper that <a href="https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/mental-ba-fact-pat">opens up subsidised sessions with psychologists and other professionals</a>. Or you may have seen a psychiatrist in private practice and got a portion back from Medicare.</p><p>Taxpayers are spending <a href="https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/mental-health-services/mental-health-services-in-australia/report-contents/expenditure-on-mental-health-related-services">$1.3 billion each year</a> on Medicare rebates for mental health care, so it's time we asked — is help getting to those who need it most?</p><a name="accessingcaregraphic"> </a><h3>Is your area getting care?</h3><p>We're about to show you some fancy charts, but to make them more relevant for you we'll need your postcode, or a postcode you're curious about. Don't worry, we're not storing or re-using this information.</p><a name="postcodesearch"> </a><p>This year, we've all become experts in reading curvy lines. But we're about to show you a curve you might not have seen before.</p><a name="scrollystagemount"> </a><a name="scrollytellerNAMEoneKEYdistressed"> </a><p>This line tracks the proportion of people experiencing a high level of psychological distress. </p><p>The data comes from the National Health Survey, which predates the pandemic but shows how people are going in regular times.</p><a name="markKEYleastmost"> </a><p>On the left we have the most disadvantaged fifth of Australians and on the right we have the least disadvantaged. </p><a name="markKEYyourquintileSWAPtruePANELyourquintile"> </a><p>[In the most disadvantaged suburbs, <strong>XX% of people </strong>are highly distressed compared with<strong> XX% in the least disadvantaged.</strong>]</p><a name="markKEYyourquintile"> </a><p>As you can see, people in advantaged areas are less distressed, which makes sense.</p><a name="markKEYmentalcondition"> </a><p>They also have lower rates of mental and behavioural conditions.</p><a name="mark"> </a><p>So you might expect the bulk of our tax dollars to be subsidising care for people living on the other end of the spectrum.</p><a name="mark"> </a><p>Let's show you just how far off the mark that is.</p><a name="endscrollyteller"> </a><h2>Where your tax dollars are going</h2><a name="scrollystagemount2"> </a><a name="scrollytellerNAMEtwoKEYallied"> </a><p>This chart shows where taxpayers are spending the most on mental health appointments through Medicare, excluding psychiatrists. </p><p>The data is from 2017-18 as that's the most recent year available.</p><a name="markKEYalliedgroups"> </a><p>Each of those dots is an area of Australia, grouped into six major categories. That dotted line shows the trend using the average of each group. </p><a name="markKEYalliedselfSWAPtruePANELalliedself"> </a><p>In your area of &lt;&lt;SYDNEY INNER CITY&gt;&gt;, taxpayers funded &lt;&lt;25.6 sessions&gt;&gt; of care per 100 people, which cost &lt;&lt;$2,790&gt;&gt;. That's &lt;&lt;more&gt;&gt; than the national average of 22.87 sessions for $2,375.</p><a name="markKEYalliedselfSWAPtruePANELalliedself2"> </a><p>This allowed &lt;&lt;5.08%&gt;&gt; of people in your area to access subsidised care, which is &lt;&lt;around&gt;&gt; the national average of 5.06%.</p><a name="markKEYhighadvantage"> </a><p>As you can see, we're spending the most on advantaged city areas.</p><a name="markKEYlowadvantage"> </a><p>Spending is lowest in remote areas, and everywhere else falls in the middle.</p><a name="markKEYlowhighadvantage"> </a><p>In fact, taxpayers are funneling five times as much dosh to highly advantaged city slickers as they are to remote Australians, and people in the regions are missing out too.</p><a name="markKEYkayetestimonialCUSTOMtruePANELkayeinitial"> </a><p>Kaye's just a few hours from inner-city Sydney, but in her neck of the woods, you're half as likely to get funding for a psychologist.</p><a name="markKEYkayetestimonial"> </a><p><em>Living in a rural community, my options are limited. It took over six weeks after a particular crisis before I was able to see a psychologist. I just had to soldier on, which is very dangerous in a mental health crisis.</em></p><p><em>It was pointless to go to the local hospital which has a very small, often understaffed mental health ward, with fly in/fly out psychiatrists. Mostly, its desperate clients are sent away to a bigger facility which means they cannot have family support if they need it. So I just had to wait. I pretty much just went to bed for six weeks.</em></p><p><em>The crackdown on opioid painkillers is just one issue in rural areas where mental health care is lacking. Add to that the ongoing trauma of the bushfires in my area and now the Covid-19 pandemic — it worries me greatly.</em></p><a name="mark"> </a><p>But it's not just country folk losing out. Even in cities, for every dollar we spend on those in wealthier areas, we spend 77 cents on people in less advantaged areas.<br/> </p><p>Mike* lives in one of those less advantaged city areas — Wollongong.</p><a name="markKEYmiketestimonialCUSTOMtruePANELmikeinitial"> </a><p><em>My quality of life goes up significantly when I can have a session every fortnight, then it goes right down again when I can't. When I'm doing well I can work a bit and take care of myself. When I'm not well I can't leave the house, can't sleep, can't care for myself or my child. It's cost me years of my life, struggling, being poor, unable to access proper health care and feeling like a useless burden on society.</em></p><p><em>It'd cost about $5000 a year for me to see my psychologist fortnightly. Contrast this against the $20,000 or so I get for the disability pension every year. If they helped me get on my feet and supported me to stay there I'd cost the taxpayers way less, and I'd be a contributing member of society.</em></p><a name="markKEYpsychiatrists"> </a><h3>The most unequal care of all</h3><p>As we can see, it's an unequal system, and nowhere is this more pronounced than when it comes to <strong>psychiatrists in private practice</strong>.</p><p>For every dollar taxpayers spend on psychiatry for remote Australians, we shell out $4.80 for people in disadvantaged city areas and $7.70 for people in our wealthiest suburbs.</p><a name="mark"> </a><p><em>I was referred to a psychiatrist to ensure that my antidepressants were the right ones for me but the appointments were $400. This is why people aren't getting diagnosed properly.</em></p><p><em>People with mental health are already struggling. To put this financial stress on them is ridiculous! I nearly had another breakdown, one step forward, two back, I couldn't get the help I needed. I was trying to improve my mental health, I didn't want to be in the dark place anymore. I wanted to continue in life.</em></p><a name="markKEYclinicalpsychologists"> </a><p>It's a similar story when we check out <strong>clinical psychologists</strong>.</p><p>For every person who sees a clinical psychologist in a remote area, six people will be accessing care in a highly-advantaged city area.<br/> </p><p>Psychiatrists and clinical psychologists are the most specialised and highly trained professionals in the mental health care system but this data suggests they're accessible for a select few only.</p><a name="markKEYgpmentalhealth"> </a><p>We can tell that Australians from all backgrounds are seeking help by looking at who's visiting <strong>GPs for mental health reasons</strong>. While there's still fewer remote Australians seeking help, the curve is flatter than other providers.</p><p>But for less advantaged Australians, the journey seems to end in their GP's office.</p><a name="mark"> </a><p>"While wealthier Australians are often getting access to quality care that combines psychology and medication, poorer Australians are often left with only medication from their GP," says Professor Graham Meadows from Monash University's Department of Psychiatry.<br/> </p><p>"Medication alone is less effective in treating mental illness and this can put them on the back foot in terms of recovery."</p><a name="endscrollyteller"> </a><h2>So what's going on?</h2><p>More than 600 Australians shared their experiences of accessing mental health care through Medicare with us, and the number one barrier cited was the cost of appointments.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.psychology.org.au/for-the-public/about-psychology/what-it-costs">recommended rate for a psychologist is $260 per session</a>, while an initial consult with a psychiatrist will set you back around $400. You can get a portion of the cost back from Medicare, but you need to have the full amount upfront and the rebate can take a couple of days.</p><p>Many Australians simply can't cough up those fees and bulk-billing psychologists are rare, with long waiting lists.</p><p>To access the Medicare rebate for a psychologist, you typically need a <a href="https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/mental-ba-fact-pat">mental health care plan from a GP</a> which involves a long appointment (double the cost), plus a review after the sixth session. That's the cost of three to four appointments before you even get to the psychologist's fees.</p><p>In response to the pandemic, the Government has temporarily increased the number of one-on-one psychology sessions you can receive a rebate on from 10 to 20 per year. Prior to this change, many readers told us the 10-session cap was limiting their recovery.</p><a name="gallery"> </a><blockquote><p>There's just not enough sessions to truly get into my trauma. I have borderline personality disorder and complex post traumatic stress disorder. I can't fix this in 10 visits. When COViD happened I had to take stress leave and was almost hospitalised. I was suicidal. The system might be OK for people with depression and anxiety but it isn't set up for people with complex mental health needs. Some people have told me to apply for the NDIS but I'm too exhausted to battle another government system. It's very hard to be mentally unwell in Australia. There is almost no support.</p><p class="p--pullquote-byline">Attribution</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>This is quotation text.</p><p class="p--pullquote-byline">Attribution</p></blockquote><a name="endgallery"> </a><p>The extra sessions are only available until June 2022, despite the Productivity Commission and the Government's Medicare taskforce suggesting it be a permanent change.</p><p>Lifting the 10-session cap would allow psychologists to use forms of therapy that take longer but produce better results for some conditions, like complex trauma and borderline personality disorder, which can't be treated with the kind of therapy you can deliver in 10 sessions.</p><p><strong>COULD MAYBE CUT THIS QUOTE: "It would be great to have the number of sessions based upon the client's needs and the associated evidence base," says Dr Simon Knowles from Swinburne University.</strong></p><p><strong>"We also need to acknowledge that for some members of our community, chronic health issues require ongoing access to support."</strong></p><p>But increasing the number of rebated sessions won't help those Australians who can't afford the gap fee to begin with.</p><p>Psychologists say they have to charge a gap fee as the Medicare rebate doesn't come close to covering their costs. The rebate hasn't increased since 2012, yet the costs of running a practice increase every year — which is passed on to patients.</p><p>"To make it a truly universal system, you'd need to do something dramatic — maybe lift the rebate to a reasonable level and then make gap fees illegal," says Professor Meadows.</p><p>"Or, instead of having this fee-for-service model of privatised care, you put the almost-billion dollars a year of funding into bulk-billing psychological services in every area."</p><p>"Within the current model, telehealth could lower gap fees by removing some of the costs of running a physical practice — but there's no guarantee those savings would be passed on to patients."</p><a name="timegraphic"> </a><h3>Therapy takes time</h3><p>Money isn't the only barrier. As they say, time is money, and "lower-income Australians typically have greater demands on their time," according to Jennifer Smith-Merry, director of the Centre for Disability Research and Policy at the University of Sydney.</p><p>Like most Australians, psychologists work during business hours with limited after-hours sessions that can fill up quickly.</p><p>As they're more likely to operate in wealthier, city areas where people can cop the gap fees, everyone else must hike across town, which can take longer than the appointment itself.</p><p>[MORE TESTIMONIALS GO HERE]</p><p>Again, telehealth could help. The Productivity Commission recommends it, but the Government has long-resisted calls to offer telehealth outside of the pandemic.</p><p>But does mental health care have to involve an hour on the couch? Dr Sebastian Rosenberg from the University of Sydney <a href="https://theconversation.com/online-therapies-can-improve-mental-health-and-there-are-no-barriers-to-accessing-them-111357">has argued</a> free online therapy courses with a variety of durations that could be accessed at any time would be accessible for more Australians. Online programs could also be made culturally sensitive, getting around the fact that psychologists are overwhelmingly white.</p><p>However, many psychologists feel online programs are inadequate, saying the most important thing for healing is the personal relationship between therapist and client.</p><p>Still, it's clear the one-size-fits-all approach is failing to serve Australians from all backgrounds.</p><p>"There's growing discussions overseas about how psychologists are largely from affluent backgrounds, university-educated and from inner-city areas" says Professor Meadows.</p><p>"You can see how someone from a different background might not feel a connection with that kind of person. So we need to recognise that different groups need different approaches."</p><h3>Affordable care exists, but there's a catch</h3><p>We've looked at the providers where care is most unequal, but what about those that are doing better?</p><p>Let's return to our dots for a second.</p><a name="scrollystagemount3"> </a><a name="scrollytellerNAMEthreeKEYotherallied"> </a><p>The only services that aren't heavily skewed towards more advantaged city folk are provided by <strong>"other" allied mental health</strong> workers — a group that includes mental health nurses, Aboriginal health workers and some accredited social workers and occupational therapists.</p><p>We spend so little on this group of health providers that we need to zoom in to see the trends.</p><a name="markKEYotheralliedzoom"> </a><p>Finally, we see a flattening of the curve, with the exception of the most remote Australians.</p><p>The reason these providers are more accessible is because rather than operating in private practice, they're usually employed by organisations whose mandate is to reach disadvantaged or isolated areas.</p><p>But unfortunately, <em>very few</em> people are receiving these services.</p><a name="markSWAPtruePANELotherallied"> </a><p>In your area of &lt;&lt;SYDNEY INNER CITY&gt;&gt;, just &lt;&lt;1%&gt;&gt; of people received this kind of care, compared with &lt;&lt;5%&gt;&gt; who saw a clinical psychologist.</p><a name="markKEYgpfocus"> </a><p>Some <strong>GPs</strong> also have special training to offer <strong>family or individual therapy</strong>, but this is used even less. While this could be a way of offering accessible therapy for low-income families, just over 16,000 people access this care yearly.</p><a name="endscrollyteller"> </a><p>So, while more equitable care exists, it's not being widely deployed.<br/> </p><p>Compounding the problem, Medicare offers no rebate to see counsellors or other highly trained therapists, who typically have lower fees than psychologists.</p><p>This is designed to prioritise forms of care with the strongest evidence base. But the exclusion means a large chunk of Australia's mental health workforce is effectively underutilised, while patients are locked into care they often can't afford beyond 10 sessions.</p><p><strong>TESTIMONIALS</strong></p><p>Making matters worse, organisations who traditionally employed psychologists (like hospitals, companies and universities) realised over the years that they could save money by sending people to the Medicare system instead, where consumers must foot the gap fee. This practice of "cost shifting" has seen the number of psychologists employed by organisations shrink, according to the Australian Psychological Society.</p><a name="distancegraphic"> </a><h2>How do we burst the city bubble?</h2><p>So what would it take to make access to psychologists look less like this?</p><a name="averagechartmount"> </a><p>To reverse the city skew, we could start by introducing <strong>formal incentives for psychologists to work outside of major cities, like we have for doctors</strong>.</p><p>We could also work to remove the barriers to telehealth for country Australians, like poor internet access and having to visit a GP in person for a referral.</p><blockquote><p><em>Earlier this year, I was told a mental health care plan was not available except by visiting a GP in person first. The nearest GP is a 9 hour drive. It was very discouraging and made me feel even more isolated. I waited until I had some leave and a chance to visit town, accessing three sessions in two weeks with a psychologist before returning to work in my remote community, where I was able to continue sessions through telehealth. There seem to be even fewer avenues for mental health support for Aboriginal people living in remote areas.</em></p><blockquote class="quote--pullquote"><p class="p--pullquote-byline"><em>Anonymous—female</em></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>Rather than expecting the current system to work everywhere, we need to tailor services to the realities of country areas, according to Dr Smith-Merry.</p><p>"Better Access was not really built with the different types of approaches you need in those areas. Yet people with disadvantage are more likely to live there."</p><h2>'It saved me'</h2><p>As bleak as 2020 has been, it also presents an opportunity for reform, according to Dr Knowles.</p><p>"The pandemic has no doubt made us all reflect on mental health and where changes can and should be made to help improve access to support."</p><p>From the hundreds of testimonials you sent us, one theme was clear: when you were able to access care, it was life-changing.</p><p><strong>HAPPY TESTIMONIALS</strong><br/> </p><p><em>*Names changed to protect privacy</em></p><p><br/> </p><h2>Credits:</h2><p>Reporting and data analysis: <a href="/news/mobile/annika-blau/9283270" target="_self" title="">Annika Blau</a></p><p>Developer: <a href="/news/mobile/joshua-byrd/8609896" target="_self" title="">Joshua Byrd</a></p><p>Designer: <a href="/news/mobile/georgina-piper/9255388" target="_self" title="">Georgina Piper</a></p><p>Editor: <a href="/news/mobile/matt-liddy/201998" target="_self" title="">Matt Liddy</a></p><h2>About the data:</h2><ul><li><p>The proportion of Australians who are highly distressed and the proportion experiencing a mental or behavioural condition come from the 2017-18 National Health Survey (Australian Bureau of Statistics).</p><ul><li>Proportions are shown by Index of Relative Socio-Economic Disadvantage quintile.
